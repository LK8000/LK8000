/*  module magfield.c */

/* Module to calculate magnetic variation and field given position,
**               altitude, and date
** Implements the NIMA (formerly DMA) WMM and IGRF models
**
**    http://www.nima.mil/GandG/ngdc-wmm2000.html
**    For WMM2000 coefficients:
**    ftp://ftp.ngdc.noaa.gov/Solid_Earth/Mainfld_Mag/DoD_Model/wmm.cof
**    For IGRF/DGRF coefficients:

**
**  The routine uses a spherical harmonic expansion of the magnetic
** potential up to twelfth order, together with its time variation, as
** described in Chapter 4 of "Geomagnetism, Vol 1, Ed. J.A.Jacobs,
** Academic Press (London 1987)". The program first converts geodetic
** coordinates (lat/long on elliptic earth and altitude) to spherical
** geocentric (spherical lat/long and radius) coordinates. Using this,
** the spherical (B_r, B_theta, B_phi) magnetic field components are
** computed from the model. These are finally referred to surface (X, Y,
** Z) coordinates.
**
**   Fields are accurate to better than 200nT, variation and dip to
** better than 0.5 degrees, with the exception of the declination near
** the magnetic poles (where it is ill-defined) where the error may reach
** 4 degrees or more.
**
**   Variation is undefined at both the geographic and  
** magnetic poles, even though the field itself is well-behaved. To
** avoid the routine blowing up, latitude entries corresponding to
** the geographic poles are slightly offset. At the magnetic poles,
** the routine returns zero variation.

** HISTORY
** Adapted from EAW Excel 3.0 version 3/27/94 EAW
** Recoded in C++ by Starry Chan
** WMM95 added and rearranged in ANSI-C EAW 7/9/95
** Put shell around program and made Borland & GCC compatible EAW 11/22/95
** IGRF95 added 2/96 EAW
** WMM2000 IGR2000 added 2/00 EAW
** Released under GPL  3/26/00 EAW
** Adaptions and modifications for the SimGear project  3/27/2000 CLO
** Removed all pow() calls and made static roots[][] arrays to
** save many sqrt() calls on subsequent invocations
** 3/28/2000  Norman Vine -- nhv@yahoo.com
** Put in some bullet-proofing to handle magnetic and geographic poles.
** 3/28/2000 EAW
** Added missing comment close, the lack of which caused the altitude 
** correction to be omitted.
** 01/31/01 Jim Seymour (jseymour@LinxNet.com)
** 1/16/05 EAW  added wmm2005 igrf2005 models
** modified code for n=13 expansion for igrf2005
** 1/28/12 EAW added wmm2010
