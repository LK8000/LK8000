# WAYNOTES.TXT
# ATTENTION PLEASE: THIS FILE IS THE DEMO WAYPOINT NOTES, ONLY AS AN EXAMPLE. 
# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BECAUSE IT WILL BE OVERWRITTEN ON THE NEXT LK UPDATE OR UPGRADE.
# YOU CAN COPY AND RENAME IT, EDIT IT, AND SELECT IT FROM SYSTEM CONFIGURATION MENU 1.
#
# For any waypoint, you can add additional full screen notes with long text descriptions.
# The only constraint is that in order to be correlated to a waypoint, you need to specify
# its name as-it-is in the waypoint file.  
# When you enter waypoint details, then, scroll to the second page of details and these informations
# will magically appear.
# 
# Example for a waypoint called "MyLanding Place" and for another waypoint called "JFKENNEDY"

[MyLanding Place]

Radio frequency 122.750 
Any text can be put here, uppercase or lowercase, with carriage return to split lines as well.
Many lines of text, 

even separated by blank lines. It is just like an ordinary text note.
This text note is related to the waypoint called MyLanding Place
Notice that I have exactly used the same name I have in the waypoint file database, otherwise
it wouldnt be recognized.

This text note ends when a new one starts. Very easy. 

[JFKENNEDY=PREF]

This is the big Airport. Any text can be put here.
Why have I put the =PREF  ? Because I want the Bestalternate search function to select this one before any other.
I can have as many PREF waypoints as I want, but of course this applies only to landables waypoints, and I wouldnt
set it for an outlanding place! 
You normally want to set the =PREF option only for places you can be towed from, or winch launched...

[LONDON=HOME]

Now, if you have a waypoint named LONDON, and it is a landable place, setting the =HOME  flag will make it
your home place automatically. Otherwise, as you know, you have to either set the home flah in the waypoint list,
or elect as home a waypoint after selecting it, entering waypoint details, and going to the last page.

Paragliders will not have to use it, because Home is automatically matched to the TAKEOFF place everytime.
That's all for it.

# Reporting points (Oracle): add reportingpoint=north, south, east, west or * to a waypoint.
# When you are within about 10 km and flying in the matching direction, the Oracle will show it.
# reportingpoint=south -> show when flying northbound; reportingpoint=north -> when southbound;
# reportingpoint=east -> when flying westbound; reportingpoint=west -> when flying eastbound.
# reportingpoint=* -> show for any heading (easier to read than "all").

# [Hohe Munde]
# reportingpoint=north
#
# [Venet-Berg]
# reportingpoint=south
#
# [KoenigsdorfWP]
# reportingpoint=*
