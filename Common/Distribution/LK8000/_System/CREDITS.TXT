Here you can select how you want to be tracked.
in flight only: tracking starts after takeoff and ends after landing detection.

We recomend in flight only because it transfers the takeoff and landing information for a correct log. (default)
while permanent can be used to test your tracking settings on ground. (Note: Tracking need a falid GPS fix)
