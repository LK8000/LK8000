@100
Sets the level of detail of the configuration settings.
[Basic]: Only basic settings are shown.
[Expert]: Basic and advanced settings are shown.

@101
The name of the file containing TOPOLOGY, and only optionally also terrain, waypoints, airspaces. 
The .LKM is really a ZIP file, renamed. If you change suffix to ZIP you can open it and change contents.
Map files are located inside the _Maps subfolder.

@102
The name of the file containing digital elevation terrain data, normally a .DEM file. 
This file is inside _Maps subfolder. 

@103
Primary waypoints file.  Waypoint files are located inside _Waypoints subfolder.
You can use Winpilot DAT files, SeeYou CUP files, COMPEgps WPT files.
ATTENTION: when you create a NEW waypoint, it will be saved inside file 1, with the corresponding format.

@104
Secondary waypoints file.  Waypoint files are located inside _Waypoints subfolder.
You can use Winpilot .DAT files, SeeYou .CUP files, or COMPEgps .wpt files.

@105
The file name of the primary airspace file.
Airspace files are located inside _Airspaces subfolder.

@106
The file name of the secondary airspace file.

@107
For each airfield, you can add additional informations inside this file located in _Waypoints subdirectory.
Here you can change this default file name to something else.

# 108 OBSOLETED BY 1250 in 2.3
@108
Controls filtering of airspace for display and warnings.  The airspace filter button also allows filtering of display and warnings independently for each airspace class.
[All on] All is displayed.
[Clip] Only airspace below the clip altitude.
[Auto] All within a margin of the glider.
[All below] All airspace below the glider.

@109
For clip airspace mode, this is the altitude below which airspace is displayed.

# 110 OBSOLETED BY 1251 in 2.3
@110
For auto airspace mode, this is the altitude above/below which airspace is included.

@111
Enable/disable all airspace warnings.

@112
This is the time before an airspace incursion is estimated at which the system will warn the pilot.

@113
This is the time period in which an acknowledged airspace warning will not be repeated.

@114
Draw a black outline around each airspace rather than the airspace color

@115
Draws digital elevation terrain on the map.
This is shaded by the wind direction: upwind is brighter, downwind darker.

@116
Draw topological features (roads, rivers, lakes etc) on the map.  Requires the topology file to be specified.

@117
Defines the amount of phong shading in the terrain rendering.  Use large values to emphasise terrain slope, 
smaller values if flying in steep mountains.

@118
Defines the brightness (whiteness) of the terrain rendering.  This controls the average illumination of the terrain.

@119
Defines the color ramp used in terrain rendering.

@120
Enable or disable moving map shade/slope effect. You can also enable/disable shading from the Screen View menu buttons.
However, if you disable shading here it will be disabled forever, and you will not be able to enable it from Screen View.

@121
If NO TERRAIN is used, this is the color to be used as a background. Note that some colors are suitable for no topology use, 
other are suitable for topology, etc. 

@122
Set a limit to how many labels, including topology, landables and waypoints, can be printed on the map.
The decluttering engine is already taking care not to overlap labels. This setting is useful to speed up map display when 
you have a huge number of topology and waypoints and a slow CPU device. Normally you can leave it to the default value, 70.

@123
Determines how labels are displayed with each waypoint:
[Names] The full name of each waypoint is displayed.
[Numbers] The waypoint number of each waypoint is displayed.
[None] No names are displayed with the waypoints.
[Names in task] Names are only displayed for waypoints that are in the active task as well as the home airfield.
[First Three] The first 3 letters of the waypoint name are displayed.
[First Five] The first 5 letters of the waypoint name are displayed.

@124
Determines whether and how long a snail trail is drawn behind the glider

@125
Determines how the screen is rotated with the glider:
[North up] The moving map display will always be orientated north to south and the glider icon will be rotated to show its course.
[North smart] is like North up, but the glider icon is repositioned automatically to make more space for map forward.
This modality works only in landscape mode. For portrait mode, it is identical to North Up. In North Smart it is not possible
to reposition the glider manually from menu buttons.
[Track up] The moving map display will be rotated so the glider's track is oriented up.
[North up when circling] Track-up in cruise and north-up when circling.
[Target up when circling] Track-up in cruise and the bearing to next waypoint up when circling.
[North/track] North-up in cruise, glider track-track up in circling

@126
When zoom level is greater or equal to this value, map orientation will change to NorthUp. 
If below this value, the Orientation setting will be used normally. 
Setting an high value will result in never using this option. 

@127
Auto-zoom changes the zoom level during flight so that the map zooms in as the active waypoint is approached.  
After passing a waypoint, the map zooms out to the next waypoint.
Manually changing the zoom will disable Auto zoom.

@128
Determines whether the snail trail is drifted with the wind when displayed in circling mode.

@129
Sets the width of the snail trail display.

@130
If enabled, then the map will zoom in automatically when entering circling mode and zoom out automatically when leaving circling mode.

@131
Waypoints labels have priority over topology labels, so many waypoints on the map will deny topology labels to appear. 
Here you can define how much you want wp labels closed to each other, using the LK8000 decluttering engine.
DISABLE will show all waypoints on the map also overlapping each other,
LOW will not show overlapping waypoint names but will fill up the map as much as possible,
MEDIUM and HIGH will leave more space between waypoint labels, leaving more space for topology labels,
VERY HIGH will separate wp labels a lot, almost giving priority to topology labels.

@132
DISABLE will show informations for all reachable and landable waypoints which are visible on the map, 
LOW will not show outlandings if there are better airports available, 
HIGH will try to avoid showing airports close to other better airfields.


@133
The height above terrain that the glider should arrive at for a safe landing. Do NOT let it zero! A good value is 300m

@134
Apply safety altitude to landing points only, or also to turnpoints. If only to landables, then arrival altitude over turnpoints will NOT consider any extra margin.
[Landables only] add extra altitude to landables only. This is the default.
[Landables and turnpoints] Apply extra altitude for all waypoints."

@135
The height above terrain that the glider must clear during final glide, and to pass obstacles. A good value is 50m

@136
The MacCready setting used for determining arrival altitude at airfields. A good value is 0.5ms

@137
If landable waypoints are available, BestAlternate will warn you when you are loosing any reachable landing place, 
and when your best alternate option is changing. Warnings will not happen below a critical altitude, in order not to disturb you.

@138
This determines whether the configuration settings dialog is accessible during flight. 

@139
This allows switching on or off the automatic wind algorithm.  When the algorithm is switched off, 
the pilot is responsible for setting the wind estimate.
[Circling] Requires only a GPS source
[ZigZag] requires an intelligent vario with airspeed output.
[Both] Use ZigZag and circling.
[External] Use only wind calculated by external instrument (like CAI, LX, ZANDER etc.)

@140
This is the INDICATED AIR SPEED to hold in straight flight before asking for TrueWind calculation. 
Keep heading to NSWE looking at your compass, and keep this speed on your anemometer for some seconds, 
then press the dedicated TrustWind button. Since you don't have an air probe to tell LK8000 what is your Indicated Air Speed, 
LK will assume you will be using this value.
IF YOU DO HAVE an airspeed probe, this value is NOT used since the wind is automatically calculated using that IAS.
Minimum speed is 5 knots or 10 kmh, default is 100kmh or 54 knots. 

@141
To calculate the wind during straight flight, you must bear heading and speed for some seconds. 
Decide for how many seconds you need to keep steady values. Default is 10 seconds. 
Longer time is hard to deal with. Shorter times are more easy to achieve, but may give more inaccurate results below 10 seconds.
There is a tolerance of 30% relative to this parameter. 

@142
This option defines which auto MacCready algorithm is used.
[Final glide] adjusts Mc for fastest arrival.
[Average] sets Mc to the average climb rate across all climbs.
[Both] Uses average during task, then fastest arrival when in final glide mode.
[Equivalent MC] Use MC calculated on your current average speed. See the manual. 

@143
Average efficiency is always calculated in REAL TIME. Here you can decide on how many seconds of flight this calculation must be done.
The real distance covered second by second in this period is divided by the final difference of altitude.
So if for example you go and return back to the same point after 2 minutes, and you have set 2 minutes as period, 
averageLD will consider the total distance covered in those two minutes , 
and NOT the distance between your position 2 minutes before and your current position, that in this case could be almost zero! 
Normally for gliders a good value is 90-120 seconds, and for PG/HG 15 seconds. 
Lower values will give as a result pretty much the same as LD Instant , 
while higher values will look like LD Cruise. Other commercial instruments and software use 2 minutes. 

@144
The estimate of the center of lift is displayed when in circling mode.
[OFF] Thermal center locator disabled.
[Mark center]  A thermal marker is displayed at the center of lift.
[Pan to center] A marker is displayed at the center of lift,
 and when circling, the display is panned to this lift center.

@145
When enabled and the Thermal Locator is also active, a sound tone will be played while circling when 
it is time to reduce the turn rate and go straight a bit.

@146
This option enables automatic forcing of final glide mode if the aircraft is above final glide prior to reaching the penultimate 
waypoint.  Forcing final glide early can also be performed manually from the task menu.

@147
When enabled and if connected to a barometric altimeter, barometric altitude is used for all navigation functions. 
Otherwise GPS altitude is used.

@156
Bit format, normally 8

@157
Type of secondary device.
The secondary device may be used as backup GPS data or other data e.g. from an intelligent variometer.
Generic can be used for GPS sources including FLARM.

@158
Geoid altitude correction applies only to GPS altitude, not to barometric altitude. If you have barometric altitude and you chose
to use it, this parameter is not so important.
If you don't have a baro altitude available, then you should check that the GPS input is already compensated for Geoid separation or not.
If the altitude on ground is 30 to 50m constantly wrong, you should either enable or disable this setting. If in doubt, leave it enabled.
Some GPS already compensate for geoid separation.
Condor simulator need this setting OFF.
Default is ON.

@159
Adjust GPS altitude with a fixed offset. Be careful with this setting: your offset will modify gps height permanently during the flight!
Before changing this value, check that the Geoid altitude separation is applied correctly. Default value is 0.
This value IS saved to the registry!

@160
If you experience connection slowdown with your GPS device, or intermittent breaks, try setting Polling mode.
Default is Normal, and for PC this choice has no effect. 

@161
Enabled by default, set Disabled to ignore NMEA errors and keep using the data.

@162
Maximum speed allowed in start observation zone.  Set to 0 for no limit.

@163
Maximum speed to above maximum start speed to tolerate.  Set to 0 for no tolerance.

@164
Maximum height above ground while starting the task.  Set to 0 for no limit.

@165
Maximum height above maximum start height to tolerate.  Set to 0 for no tolerance.

@166
Reference used for start max height rule
[MSL] Reference is altitude above mean sea level
[AGL] Reference is the height above the start point

@167
Minimum height above ground while finishing the task.  Set to 0 for no limit.

@168
If enabled, this option requires maximum loss of height between the start and finish of a task to be not bigger than 1000m for tasks longer than 100km or 1% of the task distance otherwise.
Larger height loss may invalidate your soaring performance!

@169
Rules used for calculating optimal points for OnLine Contest.
[Sprint]: Conforms to FAI IGC League rules.  Up to 5 points including start and finish, maximum duration 2.5 hours, 
finish height must not be below start height.
[Triangle]: Conforms to FAI OLC triangle rules.  Four points with common start and finish.  
For tasks longer than 500km, no leg less than 25% or larger than 45%; otherwise no leg less than 28% of total. 
Finish height must not be lower than start height less 1000 meters.
[Classic]: Conforms to OLC classic rules.  Up to seven points including start and finish, finish height must not be lower than start height less 1000 meters.  Points awarded 80% on second last leg and 60% on last leg.

@178
If ON, short clicking on the map will show the nearest waypoint's details.
If OFF, short clicking in the upper half area of the map will zoom in, in the lower part will zoom out.
Default is OFF.

# 179 REMOVED after v2.3
@179
When enabled, the map screen is divided in three virtual parts. Pressing for about 1 second on the upper part will result in a UP key, in the lower part into a DOWN key, and in the middle part into an ENTER key.
These up down and enter keys may be applied to change IBOX values such as MC, destination waypoint in a task, etc. 
once an infobox has been selected in IBOX mode.
To select a waypoint on the map, do a quick click on it, as short as possible. 
Remember than longer clicks may be interpreted as a virtual key!
To select an airspace on the map, press for about half a second on it.
If you do an ENTER key on the map, you will invert text colors.
If you are NOT using active map, it is better not to enable virtual keys because zoom in in and out will require very short clicks.

@180
Gestures are always enabled in LK8000, but you can choose if you want them like on Iphone or inverted.
For example, a gesture from left to right is a TURN PAGE LEFT on Iphones and many other similar devices.
The same gesture otherwise will result in a TURN PAGE RIGHT.
Default is INVERTED, opposite to Iphone usage.

# 181 REMOVED after 2.3
@181
If enabled, clicking on a navbox will lock the moving map preventing waypoint selection or zoom actions. Double click on the moving map (NOT on navboxes) will unlock the map.
This feature can be useful to PG and delta pilots, and by default it is OFF. 

@182
This determines how long menus will appear on screen if the user does not make any button presses or interacts with the computer.

@183
Defines the location of the glider drawn on the screen in percent from the bottom.

@184
Two styles are available: Vector or Alternate. 
Vector waypoints will show runway orientation, radio, and other informations.

@185
Choose how to display values for landable waypoints. With or without a box around, with or without units (meters, feet).

@186
Can show arrival altitude over safety, or required efficiency to arrive over safety.

@187
If ON, bottom bar and LK pages are white with black text. The overlay text color will be reversed, so if you have set black they will be white. You can reverse these colors with a custom key. DEFAULT IS OFF.

@188
Change the color of text on the screen: ALL BLACK will use black for all values and names, VALUES WHITE will show map values and air ports in outlined white style, and ALL WHITE will set outlined white for everything including outlandings and generic turnpoints..

@189
Choose the color of map overlays. Default is white, which becomes automatically black when reversed.  Some colors are reversable, some others are not. You may experiment with combinations. 

@190
LK Page 2.3 is listing nearest Turnpoints. Here you define what to list.
NO LANDABLES  will not include in this list all turnpoints that are also landable, and thus part of pages 2.1 or 2.2. This is the default setting.
ALL WAYPOINTS will include also landables that you already have listed in 2.1 and 2.2 .
DAT TURNPOINTS will include only waypoints that have a T flag. This is useful only for people using DAT waypoint files, since SeeYou CUP waypoints are all marked with a T flag.
This filter does not affect any other functionality. 

@191
Do not display units like Km, Ft, etc. in the infoboxes and in LK8000 mode.
Some low-resolution screens may require this setting to save some space, expecially 320x240 ones!

@192
Only Map related fonts and dialogues can be customized, if needed. PC version does not allow to change fonts.
LK specific fonts cannot be customized.

@193
Draw overlay values on moving map.
[Half mode] show destination waypoint and distance, and other values on the right (MC, requested efficiency and arrival altitude difference for gliders).
[Full mode] will add also left overlays values and the clock, if enabled. See the manual.

@194
This determines whether the glide range is shown on the map:
[OFF] Not shown
[Line] Draws a dashed line at the glide range
[Shade] Shades terrain outside glide range (only during flight, not when on ground)
[...+NextWP] Also shows glide range from active waypoint (WP) given current predicted arrival altitude at WP
With any choice but "OFF", a red "X" will appear if the current destination is reachable in terms of glide ratio, but unreachable because of an obstacle.
By the red "X" is shown the altitude you must gain to clear the obstacle.
This altitude takes into account the terrain safety margin configured in safety menu.

# 195 UNUSED SINCE 2.4
@195
Glide bar can be relative to Task Finish or to the next turnpoint, or it can be disabled. This bar is drawn on the left side of the screen.
Value is calculated for current MC, being a task value: if you dont have a task but only a single goto, 
then this value may be different from overlay waypoint arrival, because this value is always calculated for current MC even below safetyMC. Landables will consider safety altitude as usual.

@196
The vario bar appears on the left of the screen. It is useful ONLY if you have a real vario connected, or a fast barometric altitude reading.

@197
A blue profile of thermals will appear during circling on the left upper part of the map. 

@198
Track line does not appear on low zoom levels. 

@199
This enables the display of FLARM traffic on the map window
[Disabled] No Flarm objects will be shown on map
[Enabled] Flarm object will appear on the map in their real position

@200
Determines how waypoints are advanced when flying the task.
[Manual] User must manually advance each waypoint.
[Auto] Waypoint automatically advances as soon as glider intercepts waypoint (cylinder,sector or line) including Start.
[Arm] User must manually Arm every waypoint before it will advance (including the Start). This option is RECOMMENDED for AAT tasks!
[Arm start] User must manually Arm the Start waypoint before the task will start. All other waypoints automatically advance.
[Arm TPs] User must manually Arm each turnpoint, but Start waypoint will be advanced automatically.

@201
Type of the start.
[Line]: The task is started when the line is crossed.  The line length is set via the 'Start radius' property.
[Cylinder]: The task is started when the glider leaves the cylinder.  The cylinder radius is set via the 'Start radius' property.
[FAI Sector]: Defines a 90 degree sector.  The task is started when the glider crosses the sector lines.  
The radius of the sector is set via the 'Start radius' property.

@202
Radius of the start cylinder/sector or half-length of the start line.

@203
Type of sectors used for non-AAT tasks.
[Cylinder]  Barrel cylinder of specified radius.
[FAI sector]  90 degree sector centered at bisector at specified radius
[DAe 0.5/10] German national sector type, equivalent to 0.5 km radius barrel and 10 km FAI sector.

@204
Radius of the turnpoint observation area for non-AAT tasks.

@205
Type of the finish.
[Line]: The task is finished when the line is crossed.  The line length is set via the 'Finish radius' property.

Specifies how much of the water ballast is loaded in the glider.
The total volume of the water ballast is defined in a glider polar data.
Press DUMP BALLAST button to toggle countdown of the ballast volume according to the dump rate specified in s
ystem configuration.

@301
Wing loading for this glider. It depends on your weight, on additional equipments installed, etc.
You should set Wing Loading with no ballast first.
This value is NOT saved, and it is reset at each startup to the wing loading calculated for your polar. 
Normally, but not always, your polar has considered a 70kg weight pilot. If you are not sure, leave the default wing loading. 

@302
How clean the glider is. Set to 100% for clean, lower numbers as the wings pick up bugs or get wet.  50% indicates the glider's sink rate is doubled. 

@303
ONLY for BARO ALTITUDE when available! IF no baro altitude, this config will do nothing!
this is the Area pressure for barometric altimeter calibration.  Some external vario will set it automatically, 
some other require your action. Changing QNH will set new barometric altitude accordingly. If you change altitude in the next box, QNH will be set accordingly too.
You normally set the correct altitude on ground, and set a new QNH while flying if an AFIS radio service will tell you the new QNH.
Again, this is about Barometric altitude, and if you don't have baro altitude fed to LK it will do nothing.
The standard pressure for the QNE altitude is 1013.2 . This is the default. If you don't understand what we are talking about, do not change the QNH.

@304
Change the baro altitude here. You need of course a baro altitude being fed to LK, otherwise this value will constantly be ZERO.
Changing baro altitude will set QNH accordingly, automatically.
If you want to set the QNE altitude, regulate the QNH to 1013.2 

@305

#
# CUSTOM KEYS
#

@400
Some custom keys are obtained by clicking on the bottom bar for at least some time.
Below this time, the click will rotate as usual the LK8000 pages.

# WEATHER RASP - NO NEED TO TRANSLATE SINCE RASP IS NOT YET WORKING CORRECTLY IN LK8000
#

@650
[Terrain]
Display terrain on map, no weather data displayed.

@651
[Wstar]
Average dry thermal updraft strength near mid-BL height.  
Subtract glider descent rate to get average vario reading for cloudless thermals.
Updraft strengths will be stronger than this forecast if convective clouds are present,
since cloud condensation adds buoyancy aloft (i.e. this negects cloudsuck).  
W* depends upon both the surface heating and the BL depth.

@652
[BL wind spd]
The speed and direction of the vector-averaged wind in the BL.  
This prediction can be misleading if there is a large change in wind direction through the BL.

@653
[H bl]
Height of the top of the mixing layer, which for thermal convection is the average top of a dry thermal.
Over flat terrain, maximum thermalling heights will be lower due to the glider descent rate and other factors.
In the presence of clouds (which release additional buoyancy aloft, creating cloudsuck) the updraft top will 
be above this forecast, but the maximum thermalling height will then be limited by the cloud base.
Further, when the mixing results from shear turbulence rather than thermal mixing this parameter is not useful for glider flying. 

@654
[dwcrit]
This parameter estimates the height above ground at which the average dry updraft strength drops below 225 fpm 
and is expected to give better quantitative numbers for the maximum cloudless thermalling height than the BL Top height,
especially when mixing results from vertical wind shear rather than thermals. 
(Note: the present assumptions tend to underpredict the max. thermalling height for dry consitions.)
In the presence of clouds the maximum thermalling height may instead be limited by the cloud base.
Being for "dry" thermals, this parameter omits the effect of "cloudsuck".

@655
[bl cloudpct]
This parameter provides an additional means of evaluating the formation of clouds within the BL and might be used either 
in conjunction with or instead of the other cloud prediction parameters.  
It assumes a very simple relationship between cloud cover percentage and the maximum relative humidity within the BL.
The cloud base height is not predicted, but is expected to be below the BL Top height.

@656
[Sfc temp]
The temperature at a height of 2m above ground level.  This can be compared to observed surface temperatures as an indication of model simulation accuracy; 
e.g. if observed surface temperatures are significantly below those forecast, then soaring conditions will be poorer than forecast.

@657
[hwcrit]
This parameter estimates the height at which the average dry updraft strength drops below 225 fpm and is expected 
to give better quantitative numbers for the maximum cloudless thermalling height than the BL Top height, 
especially when mixing results from vertical wind shear rather than thermals. 
(Note: the present assumptions tend to underpredict the max. thermalling height for dry consitions.) 
In the presence of clouds the maximum thermalling height may instead be limited by the cloud base.  
Being for "dry" thermals, this parameter omits the effect of "cloudsuck".

@658
[wblmaxmin]
Maximum grid-area-averaged extensive upward or downward motion within the BL as created by horizontal wind convergence. 
Positive convergence is associated with local small-scale convergence lines.
Negative convergence (divergence) produces subsiding vertical motion, creating low-level inversions which limit thermalling heights.

[Bearing Difference]
The difference between the glider's track bearing, to the bearing of the next waypoint, or for AAT tasks, to the bearing to the target within the AAT sector.  
GPS navigation is based on the track bearing across the ground, and this track bearing may differ from the glider's heading when there is wind present.  
Chevrons point to the direction the glider needs to alter course to correct the bearing difference, that is, so that the glider's course made good is pointing directly at the next waypoint.  
This bearing takes into account the curvature of the Earth.

Changing QFE does not affect QNH altitudes. QFE is NOT used for calculations, it is only as a reference for the pilot.

@871
[Average efficiency]
The distance made in the configured period of time , divided by the altitude lost since then.  
Negative values are shown as oo (infin) and indicate climbing cruise (height gain). Over 200 of LD the value is shown as oo .
You can configure the period of averaging in the Special config menu. 
Suggested values for this configuration are 60, 90 or 120: lower values will be closed to Instant efficiency, and higher values will be closed to Efficiency from last thermal.
Notice that the distance is NOT the straight line between you old and current position: it's exactly the distance you have made even in a zigzag glide.
This value is not calculated while circling. 

@872
[Next Efficiency required]
The required glide ratio to reach the next waypoint, given by the distance to next waypoint divided by the height required to arrive at the SAFETY ARRIVAL ALTITUDE.
Over 199 and below 1 , no value is shown.
This is a pure geometric calculation, equal to Garmin, Naviter and most of common other instruments.

@873
[Flight Level]
Altitude Flight Level indicator. FL is expressed in hundreds of feets. 
This indicator uses the standard atmosphere altitude (1013.25hPa).
If no barometric altitude is available, the GPS altitude will be used.
In this case, it must be adjusted for QNH, by inserting the correct QNH in Basic Settings.

There is no temperature compensation, so the FL might be inaccurate.
Use it as an approximated indicator. 

@874
[Task Distance Covered]
Distance covered up to now, from the current task. You need a valid start to make it account!

@875
[Alternate arrival]
Arrival altitude difference over alternate. Press ENTER or RETURN after selecting the infobox in order to pull up its relative waypoint menu.

QNH altitude with units inverted: if you are using meters, than it will be in feet, if you are using feet than it will be in meters. 

@885
[Altern AltAGL]
Altitude above ground level with units inverted: if you are using meters, than it will be in feet, if you are using feet than it will be in meters. 

@886
[GPS Altitude]
This is the altitude reported from the GPS. Depending on your GPS device it can be quite accurate or very wrong sometimes. 
Expecially if you are using a car navigator gps, the reported altitude can be very wrong during thermalling. 
If you have no Baro Altitude available, or you havent selected it inside config menu 5, then this GPS altitude is going to be used internally for all calculations. 
QNH altitude can use either GPS or Baro altitude. 
Normally you should use as main infobox the QNH altitude, because it will always tell you what is being used internally.

@887
[MacCready Equivalent]
This is the current real McCready you are using based on current average air speed. This value cannot be changed, and it is averaged on the same amount of time of AverageLD. 
If you have no AirSpeed probe, Estimated Airspeed will be used. See the manual for more informations.

[FLAP SETTINGS]
Show current optimum flap setting based on extended polar file and current wing loading.
See the example polar file inside _Polars folder, for help on how to create an extended polar.

@914
[Airspace Vertical Distance]
Vertical distance to the SELECTED airspace. To SELECT an airspace go inside 2.4 airspace page and pull details,
there is a button for selection. Once selected the airspace will be monitored for distance in this infobox.
Negative values means that airspace altitude is below, positive means that is above you. (Like arrival altitudes)
If no airspace is selected, OR if you are already INSIDE the airspace for this distance, --- is shown.
In case of flyzones, the nearest distance is calculated where you can leave that flyzone.

@915
[Home Altitude Arrival]
Arrival altitude at the Home airfield. Calculated for current MC, uses safetyAlt and safetyMC.

@916
@917

[Max Altitude Reached]
Max altitude reached during the current flight.
It is reset at takeoff.

@923
[Max Height Gained]
This height is calculated using the min height detected AFTER the start of free flight.
This value is normally used for badges.

@924
[Head Wind Speed]
This is the wind component relative to your current track.
It is the difference between the TAS true airspeed and GS ground speed.
A positive value indicates a HEAD WIND, and a negative value indicates a TAIL WIND.
If true airspeed is not available, estimated TAS is used. 
In this case the value is only guessed against the current wind set.

[Airspace area filling]
Airspace area can be denoted by outlines only, pattern filling, or semi-transparent colors.
[Outlines only] there will be only lines on airspace area borders 
[Pattern] airspace area will be filled with selected pattern of selected color
[Pattern, borders only] airspace border area will be filled with selected pattern of selected color (warning, see below)
[Semi-Transparent] airspace area will be filled with selected solid semi-transparent color (opacity of the color can be set in 'Opacity' item) . 
[Semi-Transparent, borders only] airspace border area will be filled with selected solid semi-transparent color (opacity of the color can be set in 'Opacity' item) (warning, see below)
Transparency may not be available on some hardware devices.
Drawing airspace borders only can slow down devices with high screen resolution or slow processor. Use with caution!

@1201
[Opacity of semi-transparent airspace]
Defines how much transparent (->0%) / opaque (->100%) will be airspace area filled with solid semi-transparent color.

@1202
[Bottom Bar Opacity]
Defines how much transparent (->0%) / opaque (->100%) will be the bottom bar area on the map .
Normally the bar is black with white text, and can be reverted to white with black text on it.
Setting <30% opacity the bottom bar will be very transparent, and text color will be forced reversed.
Some combinations of opacity and reverse colors may not be suitable to navigation, but there are
infinite combinations to choose from.
Using 0% or 100%  (full transparency  or full opacity) will speed up the software a bit.
Another famous 8000 instrument is using 75% opacity.
Default is 60%.
ATTENTION: some devices do not support opacity control. In this case, opacity has no effect
and the bottom bar will be always full black or full white.

@1203
[Font Smoothing]
Font smoothing will make characters appearing with better quality.
[None] will force disabling font smoothing
[Normal] will use default quality
[Anti Aliasing] normal quality
[ClearType] advanced quality. 
Please note that on some devices like old 3850 Anti Aliasing is not working. 
On some PNAs in portrait mode, and on PPC2002, Antialiasing will work better.
Otherwise, by default LK8000 is using ClearType.
You must exit and restart LK8000 to see the effect of changes.
IMPORTANT: font smoothing configuration is loaded at startup from the
DEFAULT profile, BEFORE you select any other profile. 

@1204
[VarioBar mode]
Choose the vario value and relative bar display on the left, if enabled.
In thermal mode, only vario can be shown.
In cruise mode, also nettovario or Speed To Fly (Sollfart).
If STF is selected, the desired IAS is printed, and the bar is indicating
if you must push or pull the stick to reach that value.

The value is printed with a suffix letter indicating:
NT for netto
SF for STF

@1205
[Aircraft category]
Select your aircraft type here, and possibly change the polar file also accordingly.
Each aircraft mode has unique features, please visit the website or read the latest
manual to discover differences.
After changing category, you must restart LK in order to notice all differences.

# 1206 OBSOLETED BY 1208 in 2.3
@1206
[Aircraft type]
This contains a selection of aircrafts and wings of different performance classes.
If you want to use your own polar file, choose Custom Polar File here 
and then select it from the next configuration box.

# 1207 UNUSED in 2.3
@1207
[Custom polar file]
When Custom Polar File is the polar type, this is the name of the file containing the glide polar data.
Polars must be placed inside _Polars subfolder.
Creating a polar file is not trivial, because you need actual sink rate values and a precise
aircraft weight. Read the manual to know more about all of this. 

@1208
[Aircraft type]
This contains a selection of aircrafts and wings of different performance classes.

@1209
[Airspace warning message repeat time]
This is the time when airspace warning messages are repeated if not acknowledged.
If you flying in a forbidden airspace without acknowledging the warning message, then after this time elapses warning message pops up again.

@1210
[Airspace vertical distance margin]
If your vertical distance to an airspace base or top drops below this limit, then the yellow warning message dialog pops up.
This also affects how airspace warning icons draws on the map. 
If vertical distance (altitude difference) to airspace base or top is below this limit,
then the warning icon is displayed directly above the glider symbol to warn you. 

@1211
[Airspace warning dialog timeout]
If this time elapses, airspace warning dialog closes automatically, without pressing the close button.
In airspace warning dialog, you can see a decrementing counter on the close button caption showing the remaining time to close.

@1212
[Airspace warning map labels]
If this is on, airspace warning labels shows on the map indicating airspace name and vertical distance.

@1213
[PG autozoom threshold]
When using autozoom in PG mode, autozoom gets working only if the next waypoint gets closer than this limit.
For example if you choose 5km, it means when you're 5km to the next waypoint the autozoom will start working.
It's zoom out to 5km zoom range, and it will keep zoom in as you're approaching the waypoint.
After you reach the waypoint the previous Cruise zoom restored. And as soon you reach 5km to the next waypoint the autozoom start working again.

@1220
[Bottom Bar Configuration]
Turn on/off each bottom bar stripe while rotating navboxes.  At least one (not counting TRM0) must be on. 

@1221
[InfoPages rotation configuration]
Enable or disable each page in the rotating sequence.
If all items in a page are disabled, then this page will be skipped.
A page will be still reachable with a custom keys, eventually.
Attention: non-gliders aircrafts such as PG/HG and GA that are disabling the 1.5 Contest infopage 
will also disable all contest calculations.  If you want contest calculations, you NEED to activate 1.5.
If you are using Glider aircraft mode, then you can also disable 1.5 because calculations are made in any case.

@1250
Controls filtering of airspace for display and warnings.  The airspace filter button also allows filtering of display and warnings independently for each airspace class.
[All on] All is displayed.
[Clip] Only airspace below the clip altitude.
[Auto] All within a height margin of the glider.
[All below] All airspace below the glider and within height margin above.

@1251
Height margin used to control airspace display filtering on the moving map used only in AUTO and ALL BELOW modes. For AUTO it determines the height above and below the glider for which airspaces should be shown. 
ALL BELLOW mode will show airspaces up to specified height above the glider and all airspaces below it.

@1252
Even if you have acknowledged an airspace, after this time it will be back "active" for warnings.
You may want to be warned again while flying back home and crossing an airspace you have crossed in the morning, for example!
By default, after 15 minutes airspaces will be back "armed" for warnings.

@1253
[Alarm Max Altitude] An alarm will be triggered everytime this altitude is reached and crossed.
The alarm will not be repeated within the next 60 seconds.
After 1 minute, if altitude has been lower than Max Altitude and then becomes higher again, alarm will sound again.
To disable this alarm, set it to 0. 
The altitude used for alarm is the one chosen in Config menu 5 "Use baro altitude".
Multiple alarms set at the same altitude will have no effect.
Glider pilots should be careful not to set alarms below a safety altitude, during critical phases of flight.
Each alarm can be repeated max 30 times. After 30 times, an alarm will automatically self disable for the current flight.
The visual alarm message automatically disappears after 12 seconds.
Each alarm has a custom sound that can be changed inside _System _Sounds folder.
They are named LK_ALARM_ALTx.WAV
Default is 0 (no alarm).

# ex 195
@1254
Glide bar can be relative to Task Finish or to the next turnpoint, or it can be disabled. This bar is drawn on the left side of the screen.
When using next waypoint, or task waypoint with only final waypoint to go, then this value will be equal to the one shown on overlays.

@1255
Automatic Mac Cready setting, can be on or off. It can also be enabled and disabled during flight.
This is the default value. 

@1256
[Total Energy] When TotalEnergy is in use, LK will calculate the height you would gain by pulling up the aircraft at the current speed, up until the speed becomes the optimal for best glide. 
For example if you are flying at 200kmh with a discus with no ballast, the speed energy would be calculated as if you would pull up and slow down to 100kmh: you would certainly climb to a better altitude of course.
This speed height will be added to all arrival altitudes. By default this feature is DISABLED, for safety reasons.
If you are in doubt, leave this setting OFF.

@1257
[Efficiency]
How clean the glider is. Set to 100% for clean, lower numbers as the wings pick up bugs or get wet.  50% indicates the glider's sink rate is doubled. 
This is the default value used by Efficiency in Basic Settings menu, loaded on startup. You should normally leave this value to 100% here.

@1258
[Live tracker log interval in seconds]
Set this on (>0), if you want to enable sending position data to Leonardo live tracker services over the internet. (http://www.livetrack24.com)
This requires a GPRS/HSDPA data plan, and an active TCP/IP internet connection to the tracking server. LK uses the given server, user name and
password to login to the server. Aircraft type submitted as well. If unsure, set the default value of 0 which means off.

@1259
[Custom Menu]

@1260
[Quick gestures]
Only for paragliders and hangdliers mode: enable/disable quick gestures.
By default, quick gestures are enabled. Quick gestures allow the pilot to click
on right or left nearest/info pages to switch to next/previous like with gestures.
Using gloves during the flight will require this option be disabled.

@1261
[Takeoff safety]
During the takeoff phase, this alarm will sound when the chosen safety altitude over ground (QFE) is reached once.
For gliders this is normally the altitude above which it is possible to turn 180 and go back to the airfield, in case towing is aborted.
Set this value to 0 to disable the alarm. 
This alarm will be armed again only after landing.

@1262
[Multimap options]

@1263
[Bottom Bar AUTO]
If enabled, TRM0 bottom bar will be automatically activated while thermalling,
and deactivated after exiting thermal, even if TRM0 is disabled from rotation.

@1264
[Group Ack]
Acknowledgement of one airspace is valid for all airspaces with the same name and the same class.

@1265
[Airspace changes]
"persistent" disabled airspaces stay disabled on next programm start
"for this time only" all airspaces will be re-enabled after next programm start


@1266
[Time Gate]
For task races with at least 1 time gate, set the end local time of last gate. 
If gate number is 0, this value will be ignored.
