CAREFUL! ALL *_MENU.TXT should be UCS-2 big endian : use Notepad++ from Windows to
change them eventually, after changing and committing new ENG stuff from linux!
Also ENG_MENU.TXT  MUST BE UCS-2 !!


DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT REMOVING OR CHANGING ANYTHING ALREADY EXISTING
IN HELP, MENU OR MESSAGES, BECAUSE THEY WILL MAKE THE CODE NON-REVERSIBLE.
WE DO GARBAGE COLLECTION ALL TOGETHER, ONCE IN A YEAR, IF NEEDED.
