VERSION 2.1g


NEW

. Flytec FLYSEN firmware 3.32 support

CHANGES

(. Thermal mode can still happen during FF)
. "Ungestures": in infopages, it is possible to flip previous/next page
   simply clicking on left and right of the screen. Gestures still working
   of course, but this is much faster. Fully compatible.

. Virtual Keys are moved to Engineering menu, being very complicated and unused.
  They were introduced in 2009, when no LK8000 mode was existing yet.

. Map Lock moved to engineering menu. This modality is now obsoleted by the new
  screen locking facility available for paragliders in Config menu 1/3.

. Removed Expert/Basic mode in configuration 

. Double Baro Altitude feed supported, using only the first available on 
  any non-generic device.


FIXES

. Detect FF in thermal mode




VERSION 2.1f  110407
======================================================================================

NEW
. Variobar indicating Netto or Sollfarts (dolphin speed indicator)
  System Config menu 13 Map Overlays has a new box "VarioBar Mode".
  It is possible to have the Variometer bar displaying:
	Vario in thermal and cruise mode, as before
	Vario in thermal, Netto in cruise 
	Vario in thermal, Dolphin speed indicator in cruise (aka Sollfart)

  Due to the estimated nettovario, which is based on gps altitude differences,
  obtained every second (with a possible GPS error, also), the overall result
  may be of little use. Also, no total energy is used, to make it even worst.
  However, as many have claimed, in old gliders it is much better than the
  MacCready speed ring. Maybe. Or maybe not.


CHANGES
. Non-triangle based contests results accuracy improved for short flights
. Fix thicker line for topology on big resolutions
. Introduced UTF-8 encoding for language files
. Change WinPilot File to Custom Polar File in configuration.



BUGFIX
.  Info->Analysis pages are now refreshed correctly with 1Hz
.  Fix bug not saving new WP is waypoint file was empty
.  Fix UCS-8 encoding of COMPEgps WPT file not loading waypoints
.  Fixed a problem of 0m obstacle warning
.  Fix bug in SIM PAN mode repositioning with Customkey ON and ActiveMap ON would go nuts.



VERSION 2.1e  110331

======================================================================================
IBOX mode is still available, but no more supported for new features.

NEW

. Contest Calculation Engine "GMAT" version 1 by Mateusz Pusz
  100% new engine, realtime calculation for OLC classic, FAI triangle, 
  FAI 3 turnpoints, OLC sprint league, OLC Plus. In addition, also
  the same paths are recalculated assuming the pilot can make it back
  to the starting point, thus PREDICTING the final results.  
  All values updated in realtime, automatically. Very light CPU load, 
  will allow also very slow CPU to use the new engine. 
  Powerful, flexible, expandable!

  NOTE> The CCE Engine is available only to GLIDERS and will not currently
        calculate anything for Paragliders, GA and CAR modes.
	
. New infoboxes (21) available for all contest values. 
  THEY ARE NOT AVAILABLE IN IBOX MODE.
  These new infoboxes are all named starting with OLC, to have them grouped:
 
	OLC Classic Distance
	OLC Classic Score (based on configured handicap)
	OLC Classic Speed

	OLC Classic Predicted Distance
	OLC Classic Predicted Score
	OLC Classic Predicted Speed 

	OLC FAI 3 TPs Distance
	OLC FAI 3 TPs Speed

	OLC FAI 3 TPs Predicted Distance
	OLC FAI 3 TPs Predicted Speed

	OLC FAI triangle Distance
	OLC FAI triangle Score
	OLC FAI triangle Speed

	OLC FAI triangle Predicted Distance
	OLC FAI triangle Predicted Score
	OLC FAI triangle Predicted Speed

	OLC League Distance
	OLC League Score
	OLC League Speed

	OLC Plus Score
	OLC Plus Predicted Score

  Total 21 new values. On display, Predicted values have an asterics "*".
  (OLC Plus is only a score value, the sum of OLC classic score and FAI triangle score)
  (Predicted Speed is calculated using average speed so far)

  With all of these infoboxes you can create custom page or bottom bar stripes.
  However, there is no need to configure anything because...... 

. New CONTEST infopage 1.5 (the TRI becomes 1.6).
  This page appears only for GLIDER mode, not for paragliders, GA, CAR etc.
  The new infopage is showing all necessary values, updated in real time.

. New Info -> Analysis -> Contest   page.
  Here you can view graphical representation of selected contest, with all
  values as well. To change contest, rotating all of them, simply press
  on the "Change" button.

. Bottom bar stripe  STA3  has no more ODOmeter displayed, if Contest is in use.
  In place of ODO, the  OLC Distance is shown. 
  ODO is now available in the TRI infopage 1.6

. Free flight start detection engine. This is a very important feature for Contest
  calculation, and generally for all flight statistics, expecially altitude min and max.
  Previously, we were assuming the freeflight would start after takeoff, which is wrong
  for gliders of course.
  The new FF engine is detecting both Winch and Tow takeoffs, and it will reset flight
  stats after the real free flight has started.
  As a side effect, no thermalling mode is enabled during non-freeflight.

. New polar for Dimona motorglider

CHANGES

. Fix SIM mode PAN mode airspace display with long click on moving map.
  Using PAN mode during SIM mode, long click on a visible airspace will produce as usual
  the airspace details. If there is no airspace underlying, either because not existing in
  that position, or because Airspace display OFF was selected in menu DISPLAY 1/3, then
  long click on the moving map will result in reposition the aircraft there.
  In any case, to maintain compatibility with old version, long click on center map screen will
  always reposition the aircraft and will not recall airspace details.

. Task Edit is now available even when no waypoint files are configured. 
  It is thus possible to load a task even when no waypoints are in use, because the
  task will load its own waypoints of course

. "Show Clock" in System Config Appearance menu 13 disabled when not available.

. During takeoff, until the real free flight has started, no thermalling mode will be
  triggered.   GA and CAR mode will not enter thermalling mode in any case anymore.

BUGFIXES


. National characters problem fixed. On some devices waypoints files, airspaces files, map files
  were not loaded. They could be selected in the file list, but wouldn't load, and they would
  disappear from configuration immediately after.
  Also some flash cards were named by devices using internal unicode national characters and
  would not allow anything to work at all within LK8000.

. WINE version (Windows emulator under Unix) fixes

.  Fix bug making appearing target unit when half overlay and clock selected.
.  Fix bug not loading terrain when first .lkm selected without terrain file set 
   and then .xcm selected with terrain inside

. (2.1d fix IGC replay broken with negative latitudes and longitudes)
. (2.1c) fix Font Smoothing not working correctly, never setting ClearType on some devices




VERSION 2.1d  110309
======================================================================================

NEW

- New Setup Setting for Font Smoothing
  System Page 11 choose from None, Default, Antialiasing and Cleartype.
  On some devices/resolution/orientation sometimes one choice is better than the other.

- New SCREEN LOCKING system for paragliders.
  This feature is available only in Para/Hang Gliding mode.
  A new menu button is available in Config 1/3 page:  LOCK SCREEN.
  This feature is available only while not flying, and thus no takeoff was detected,
  otherwise it is blanked and you cannot click on it.
  Locking the screen will help paragliders not to have LK react to keypresses during the
  takeoff , when the pilot is in a critical phase.
  Screen will report "SCREEN IS LOCKED", and will remain locked until 10 SECONDS AFTER TAKEOFF.
  After 10 seconds from takeoff detected, the screen will be AUTOMATICALLY unlocked.
  If the pilot for any reason wants to unlock the screen, he can double-click on screen any
  time to do it.
  When the screen is locked, no function can be used on the touch screen, but hardware keys 
  are still operational.

- Preliminar OLC work testbench from Mateusz

- New SIM pan mode: you can now position the aircraft in pan mode during simulations in any point
  of the screen, and not only in the sight-centered, with a long click on the map.
  Example: start SIM mode, enter PAN mode, move the map where you want, choose a point on the map
  where you want to position the aircraft, and press with your finger for a couple of seconds on that point.
  Basically, earlier you could only long-click on the center, and it was complicated to position the
  map center exactly on the point selected for the new aircraft desired reposition. Now it is very easy.


CHANGES

- AAT permanently ON for paragliders in configuration. 
  With non-AT looking settings, though.

- Outlined thermal circle also for paragliders


BUGFIX

-  Bugfix Home Waypoint on multitarget not updated when unreachable 
   and not the same as a task point, or an alternate itself.

-  Bugfix finish line or sector not appearing when a task had only 2 turnpoints including start.

-  Bugfix Waypoint parser loading unusual CUP files may crash the software while loading configuration

-  Bugfix task restart was advancing to second turnpoint after start, if previously had passed 
   first turnpoint after start!  This problem was here since ever.

-  Bugfix loading airspaces, with faulty files might crash the software

-  Attempt to prevent possible problem with Battery Manager messages.

- (refix LX declaration for non standard ASCII waypoint names)

- (Infobox Title and description string terminations fixed)
  The description _and_ title also displayed if description was too long, 
  because of description null termination missing.

- (Fix bug Target 4.x page with _@M1008 and 1002 values appearing)


VERSION 2.1c  110218
======================================================================================

NEW

- Task declaration for LX Nano, LX Colibri
- Transparent Variometer Bar (options selectable inside variometer bar color config)
- New custom device LK8EX1 for external instruments sending baro and vario to LK

CHANGES

- Heap space memory check  (TO USE!)
- Center area for nearest pages selection is enlarged
- Startup sequence will issue more detailed messages if directories are missing,
  pointing the user to the real problem and solution

BUGFIX
- 2.1b problem with tokens over 999
- 2.1b bug DSX coordinates in task declaration (not a Mat's bug! Specs were wrong).
- 2.1b bug Battery Level warnings would crash the software
- OAT Outside Air Temperature not shown below 1 C degree. Now valid from -50 to 99C



VERSION 2.1b
======================================================================================

NEW 

- Logger fields "Competition Class" and "Competition ID". 
  Class example> Standard    ID Example> AG

- Airspace Class G

- Semi-transparent airspace area configuration. This will also fix problems on HTC D2 .
  Using semitransparent will slow down a bit other devices, but only a bit.

- Transparent bottom bar, configurable inside system config menu 11 "Appearance".
  Using 0% or 100% opacity will make no impact on drawing speed because alphablending will not 
  be used in these two cases, and by default 60% is used. 
  Help:
  Defines how much transparent (->0%) / opaque (->100%) will be the bottom bar area on the map .
  Normally the bar is black with white text, and can be reverted to white with black text on it.
  Setting <30% opacity the bottom bar will be very transparent, and text color will be forced reversed.
  Some combinations of opacity and reverse colors may not be suitable to navigation, but there are
  infinite combinations to choose from.
  Using 0% or 100%  (full transparency  or full opacity) will speed up the software a bit.
  Another famous 8000 instrument is using 75% opacity.
  Default is 60%.

- New device DSX supporting task declaration

- New device Flytec FLYSEN protocol, preliminar support

- New Com message "GPS data error " when using wrong baud rate on a com port


CHANGES

- Faster topology painting when huge topo maps were used.

- Waypoint Out of Terrain selection back in configuration page 1
  Use "exclude" if you are loading big continental waypoint file databases

- McCready Overlay choice in Engineering menu 1 is now saved to profile

- NEW AUTO ZOOM
    
    1. AutoZoom bugs:
    - Changing zoom in Circling Zoom disables AutoZoom
    - Changing zoom in PAN mode disables AutoZoom
    - Enabling AutoZoom in PAN mode disables PAN mode
    - Panorama Zoom not working when AutoZoom is enabled
    - Enabling AutoZoom in Panorama Zoom destroys Panorama Zoom behavior
    - AutoZoom corrupts circling and cruise zoom if waypoint switched during
      circling mode
    
    2. Other bugs:
    - Changing ZOOM in PAN mode changes fly zoom
    - Panorama Zoom corrupts fly zoom if fly mode (circling/cruise) change
     in the meantime
    - Panorama Zoom changes PAN zoom when expired
    - Opening TargetPan during Panorama Zoom destroys Panorama Zoom
    - Pan Mode while Panorama Zoom expiration destroys fly zoom level
    - PANORAMA zoom does not remember its zoom value
    
    New design:
    1. Provides separate zoom levels for each of the following:
    - CRUISE
    - CIRCLING (if CirclingZoom is enabled in SystemSetup)
    - PANORAMA
    - AUTO_ZOOM
    - PAN
    - TARGET_PAN
    2. Zoom is switched together with a switch of flight mode, and a zoom
    for previous mode is always remembered and restored. Exception here is:
    - AUTO_ZOOM - that when switched on will always calculate the best zoom
                  for the next waypoint (CRUISE zoom if a waypoint is far away
                  or calculated zoom if closer)
    - PAN - that when switched on will init with the the zoom factor of
            previous mode (current zoom factor)
    - TARGET_PAN - that when switched on will always calculate the best zoom
                  for the presentation of the waypoint in subject
    3. AutoZoom will be turned off on pilot's manual zoom change action only
    if CRUISE_ZOOM is currently used. That means that a pilot can freely
    adjust the zoom for circling, panorama or pan without worrying about
    disabling and then a need to enable AutoZoom.
    4. Advancing a waypoint to the next one when AutoZoom is enabled will
    always adjust CRUISE_ZOOM only (even if not active at that moment)

. Very fast loading of big waypoint files at startup

. Faster response of user interface when using big waypoint files

. It is now possible to load over 8000 waypoints while still keeping good user interface
  response

. Task declaration messages are more detailed
. Progress and error messages added for EW Microrecorder task declaration

. Automatic com port reset will apply after 30 seconds, previously 15 seconds, when no
  nmea source feed is found.

. BestAlternate is back available also for Paragliders/Hang Gliders. Previously it was not
  calculated any more, and disabled by rotary multitargets.  
  Para/Hang gliders disabling BestAlternate Warning inside safety config will also make it
  disappear from rotary multitarget selection.

BUGFIX

- Altitude Required (AltReqD) flipping two different values, one correct and the other wrong

- Topology labels were not correctly printed using special character sets for some languages
  They may result truncated.

- Volkslogger declaration possible problem

- Wrong polar for Ventus 2cT

- Some topology/terrain shapes may not be printed (expecially water areas such as small lakes)

- Choosing Waypoint Out of Terrain as "ask" would not save correctly the choice inside profile

- Lklanguage problem with incompatible language pack may crash the software on startup

- Waypoint distance overlay did not show on the first line, right corner, in half overlay mode
 
- Airspaces filtering too restrictive fixed
  When an aircraft was inside airspace's boundary and the Anlysis dialog
  airspaces draw line did not cross that boundary (because airspace is
  too big) the airspace was not printed in the Analysis Airspace dialog.

- Various communication problems solved. Sometimes a device after disconnection was no more seen until a 
  port reset.
