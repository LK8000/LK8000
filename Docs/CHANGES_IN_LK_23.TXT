Changes in LK8000 v2.3a


NEW

. New configuration for Polars (requires reconfiguring polar type!)
. Many new polars
. New airspace handling engine
  . New airspace storage classes (CAirspace, CAirspaceCicrle, CAirspaceArea)
  . New CAirspaceManager singleton class for managing airspace operations
  . New openair parser based on the old one
  . New airspace distance calculation algorithms

  . NOFLY/FLY airspaces introduced.
    . NOFLY zones - works like the old airspaces. You are in a wrong position when you are inside a nofly zone.
      Warning events based on this, so if you try to enter a nofly zone you get warnings to not do that.
    . FLY zones - Zones you should be in to be safe. You are in a good position when you are inside a fly zone.
      Warning event based on to remain in a fly zone, so if you try to leave it you get warnings to not do that.
      Flying to an adjacent fly zone is permitted, in that case no warnings issued. (For ex. corridors beetween
      different fly zones)
      In the openair file the AF sentence defines a zone as fly, or you can change it from the UI.

  . Current / predicted position
    Predicted position of the aircraft calculated by lk. This calculation based on current mode (circling/cruise),
    ground and vertical speed, and the configured warning time. This is the time before an airspace warning event
    is estimated at which the system will warn the pilot. Warning messages based on predicted and current position
    as well.

  . Warning levels, warning messages
    . Yellow warning:
      Your current position near a warning situation. This means that you have a possibility to be in a wrong position
      in the given warning time. (30sec by default). There are two types of yellow situation:
      Predicted warning situation - your predicted posititon in a wrong zone (same as old airspaces case)
      Near to a warning situation - You too close horizontally or vertically to a warning position.
      (Too close comes from actual speed and nearest warning point distance and from the configured warning time)
    . Red warning:
      Your current position is wrong, you shouldn't be there because that position violates airspace rules.
      (For example you enter a nofly zone, or you leave a fly zone)
    . New airspace warning dialog
      . Shows the reason of the message, warning level, name of airspace, horizontal and vertical distance, airspace
        base and top altitude
      . Dialog auto closes after a configured time automatically, or you can close it
      . There is a possibility to acknowledge the given warning level for a configured time to not show up again.
      . The old one still accessible under Info1/Analysis/Airspace/Warnings button
    . Acknowledging
      . Each airspace has a warning level and a corresponding ack level. 
      . Actual warning level calculated by LK based on distances, fly/nofly zones, etc.
      . Ack level set by the user, by acknowledging warning messages.
      . The warning message appears only if the warning level increases above the ack level. Lets see a few examples:
          1.You are circling in a position where a no warning/yellow warning situation flipping. When a yellow warning
            situation occurs a warning dialog appears. If you do not press the ack button then in every circle the new
            warning dlg will appear beacuse warning level > ack level. But if you ack the yellow warning then the dialog
            not shows up again in the yellow warning case for a configured time. If the ack time (120s) expires, then the
            ack level goes back to zero, so the warning will appear again.
          2.The same case if you are circling at a nofly zone border. Half circle inside the zone. This is a yellow/red
            warning flipping. If you ack the red warning for a time, then you won't get a new warning message on every circle.
      . Daily acknowledging
        There is a posiibility to acknowledge an airspace for a day (until lk restart). You can do that from airspace
        details dialog (long click on map), pressing the ACKDay button. Acknowledging an airspace for a day means that warning
        dialog will never appear for that airspace.
    . Warning dialog messages can be:
      . "Predicted leaving FLY zone" : Current position inside, predicted position outside a flyzone (YELLOW)
      . "Near leaving FLY zone" : Current position inside a flyzone, but you are too close to the border to leave it (YELLOW)
      . "Leaving FLY zone" : You have just leaved the fly zone (RED)
      . "Predicted entering NOFLY zone" : Current position outside, predicted position inside a nofly zone (YELLOW)
      . "Near entering NOFLY zone" : Current position outside a flyzone, but you are too close to the border to enter it (YELLOW)
      . "Entering NOFLY zone" : You have just entered the nofly zone (RED)
    . New airspace info messages
      . When leaving a nonfly zone
      . When entering a (new)fly zone

  . New UI features
    . Long click on the map shows an extended airspace details dialog. 
      . It displays the current warning and ack level for an airpsace. 
      . In the type field FLY/NOFLY displayed
      . There is a new button to set an airspace to FLY/NOFLY.
      . The order of the airspaces sorted by top altitude. Lowest first.


CHANGES

. Polars are now files inside _Polars folder, and can be viewed and edited.
. Device configuration has type "DISABLED", no more confusion.
. Changes regarding airspaces:
  . Drawing order of airspaces changed. They are draw from lowest top altitude first.
  . Infobox nearest airspace shows the horizontal distance to the nearest airspace
  . Daily acked airspaces are also drawed on the map without any change
  . In airspace details dialog (long click on map) ACKDay button behaviour changed, now it shows a simple question to toggle actual ackday setting.


BUG FIX
. Fix problem saving profiles on exit, even on CLUB versions
. Fix problem with IGC Replay and variometer values
