======================
Changes in LK8000 v2.3
======================

Version 2.3q December 17, 2011
------------------------------

NEW

.  New infoboxes for Alternates and BestAlternate Distance and Bearing

.  New configurable bottom bar TRM0 in system setup : if disabled, 
   while circling the bottom bar will not switch automatically to thermal mode.

.  CustomKey TopRight is available for PGs as well.

. New infoboxes for Max Altitude reached, Max Height Gained, Head Wind Speed.

    [Max Altitude Reached]
    Max altitude reached during the current flight.
    It is reset at takeoff and at task restart.

    [Max Height Gained]
    This height is calculated using the min and max heights detected AFTER the start of free flight.
    This value is normally used for badges.

    [Head Wind Speed]
    This is the wind component relative to your current track.
    It is the difference between the TAS true airspeed and GS ground speed.
    A positive value indicates a HEAD WIND, and a negative value indicates a TAIL WIND.
    If true airspeed is not available, estimated TAS is used.
    In this case the value is only guessed against the current wind set.


. New support for LX 16xx device

. New priority based automatic selection of baro altitudes, when more than one baro altitude is available 



CHANGES

. FLARM-on-map objects by default DISABLED, because in simulator it is annoying after a few tests

. Change bottom bar defaults NAV1 and STA3, little changes.

. Modified Airspace sideview in dlgStatistics.cpp



FIXES

. Fix 2.3p logger not using Grecord

. Fix bug not initialising TakeOffSpeedThreshold when changing profile with a new aircraft modality
   Bug found by Eric

.Fix screen "flashing" sometimes, painting only terrain.

. Fix Config/Runtime variables for AutoWind, EnableTrailDrift, AutoZoom, AltitudeMode
   All parameters that can be changed with a button at runtime should not affect the default system setup configuration.

. Fix TrailActive not loaded correctly from new profile, setting only runtime

. Fux bug in dlgStatistics not coming back to previously selected page , calling Analysis button



Version 2.3p December 3, 2011
------------------------------

NEW

. New G record validation scheme, not using DLL anymore.
  (Still using xcs key though). 
  We are adding new files in _System folder with Grecord stuff.
  This is totally temporary. GRecord validation will not be available
  for PC versions, only for PDA/PNAs.
  This version is intended to be obsoleted by 3.0 G record validation soon.

. CHANGES
  none

. FIXES

  If using a custom folder on PC in place of My Documents/LK8000 (or whatever it is called on your pc),
  then there were problems with saving task and saving history of gotos.



Version 2.3o November 25, 2011
------------------------------

NEW


. New profiles engine, will save correctly all parameters to each profile
  Will solve many load/save problems with previous engine
  It is no more using windows registry

. New CustomKey  for OLC Analysys

. Advance in Analysis pages clicking on the right part of screen like on Nearest pages.

. Add profile "RESET DEFAULT PROFILE" at startup choice, it will reset factory defaults in LK8000.


CHANGES

. Changed defaults: pilot name is hanna reitsch, NorthupAbove changed from 10 to 7. AverEffTime changed from 2 minutes to 60 seconds.
  All DEMO files are configured back, also. Retuned default zoom levels.



Version 2.3n November 18, 2011
-----------------------------

NEW


. New user friendly map scale zoom levels

. Add new autozoom threshold option for paragliders
  https://github.com/LK8000/LK8000/issues/40
  http://www.postfrontal.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=4630

. FastZoom for all devices: quickly clicking on the moving map will trigger
  a fast zoom request skipping topology painting, for a very fast map redraw.
  Sound clicks will only happening for the first zoom request, and not for the
  next fastzoom clicks, because sound clicks are slowing down PNA devices most of the times.
  The zoom speed is between 5 and 6 times faster than before.



CHANGES

. Show user friendly mapscale values with changing units as needed

. Show pg initial zoom values as numbers in config page 23

. Modify mapscale precision printed on map, give 2 decimals when using non-metric units

. Change Close button with Save button in basic config

. LK_TONEUP.WAV and TONEDOWN.WAV moved to System sounds folder.

. Remove unneeded texts from pg climb zoom config option
  As requested by users on forum


FIXES

none

-----------------------------

NEW

- Improve dlgStatistics airspace page
    -New: Show wpt name,distance,arrival altitude
    -Bugfix: Place wpt vertical marker line to the correct distance
    -New: Draw blue "estimated gliding line" based on arrival and safety altitude when looking towards selected target
    -New: Draw target bearing difference to diagram


CHANGES

- Show correct target waypoint in asp analysis

    -Show wpt name
    -Show wpt position with a white dashed line in the diagram
    -Scale diagram distance according to wpt distance
    -Draws "no data" when no wpt selected

- Make asp analysis diagram x axis scaling more user friendly

- Add YELLOW and RED colors to airspace warnings.

- Tune ungestures area: the click area for quickly flipping infopages and nearest pages
    without using gestures is enlarged a bit for better response.
    Show overtarget prefix in asp analysis page

- Faster zoom in/out for PC



FIXES

- Bugfix predicted asp warning messages can show up before takeoff

- Print correct bearing value on dlgstatistics asp analysis page

- Fix bug not showing bearing line correctly when assigned TAKEOFF as current multitarget destination.

- Fix BestCruise track indicator is only relative to T> , and should not appear in other
  multitarget modes.

- Fix final glide bar mode flashing orange and red.
  The final glide bar will no more indicate X or orange flashing, to simplify things:
  red for negative altitude, green for positive.




Version 2.3l November 4, 2011
-----------------------------

NEW

. Analysis airspace page allows now to switch beetween heading and next wp bearing.
. New customkey "Nearest airspace"

. Oracle's dialogs can be translated

CHANGES

. Improve dlgStatistics airspace page altitude resolution to 100m
  Limit Y axis range to 3300m in every case.



FIXES

. Fix dlgStatistics airspace page ground surface drawing - limit terrain alt to diagram lowest point





Version 2.3k October 28, 2011
-----------------------------

NEW


CHANGES

. It is possible to deselect a selected airspace

. Fonts for 320x240 retuned


FIXES

. Fix bug since 2.3e: waypoint search missing left and right arrows for sorting direction, distance etc.

. Fix logger header declaring PPC2003 even for PNAs

. Fix 2.3j problem on PPCs, that would not manage hide taskbar correctly, and detect the hardware keys correctly

. Reapplying bugfix by kalman may 31st 2011
  Fix cheap chinese PNA bug, when system messages appear lk is crashing with exception 0xC000001C

. Bugfix: missing drawing of an airspace disabled in previous session
  Disable, shutdown, restart, enable -> asp won't show up on map until zoom in/out

. Bugfix: asp openair parser DA sentences

    On forum Posted by GVACILOTTO on 07/10/2011 :  17:02:22
    At this version i can't see all cylinder airspaces, like a:
    AC P
    AN SBP 541 INDUSTRIAS QUIMICAS
    AL GND
    AH 2000AGL
    V X=25:21:08 S 049:02:36 W
    DA 0.53,0,360

    Parser bug in DA sentence processing fixed.

. Fix possible problem with CE6 devices, freezing the PNA after reloading terrain in configuration


Version 2.3j October 21, 2011
------------------------------


CHANGES

. Add modelname and hw type for logger header

. Waypoint engine retuned and optimized

. Terrain shading disabled at low zoom levels, automatically.
  Previously too low zoom level, resulting in shading still effective
  even at resolutions where it actually created visibility problems.

. Topology labels on 480x272 no more in italic by default.
  On a typical 4.3 inches screen we gain some space and readability.


FIXES

. Fix default profile not loading from special local directory on PC.
  The old classic folder was used to load and save DEFAULT profile, 
  of course only on PC version.

. Fix font edit problem. Enabling custom fonts would also resume old font settings that were no more tunable.
  Mainly the button and dialog fonts were affected.

. Fix language help limit of 500 characters per line.





Version 2.3i October 14, 2011
------------------------------

NEW

. Topology lines for roads and rivers are now painted with larger line width, on some resolutions.

. Dialogs xml files inside _System/Dialogs/GA  or /GLIDER  /PARAGLIDER /CAR  .
  These files - if available - have priority over the internal one.
  It is possible, now, to customise configuration dialogs and menus for each aircraft type.



FIXES

. Fix snail trail flashing colors. Colors are shown only at a meaningful zoom level, better tuned.

. Fix bug 2.3 Alarms not showing warning message correctly for feet altitude units






Version 2.3h October 6, 2011
------------------------------

NEW

. Use dedicated aircraft menus: GLIDER_MENU.TXT, PARAGLIDER_MENU.TXT, GA_MENU.TXT, CAR_MENU.TXT and DEFAULT_MENU as fallback.
  Currently these menu have the same content, to be changed.

. Add new button Auto MC Thermal+Final , missing.

. Magnetic declination internal calculator for truewind and maybe in the future for true bearings


CHANGES

. Old JPG2000 terrain files in old XCM maps are no more supported.
  If you are still using old XCM maps and you want to convert them to LKM 
  please contact us. NOTE: Norway was already converted over 60 DEG !

. Moved TotalEnergy button in another position

. Selected airspace has flashing borders

. Airspace warning generation fine-tuning nonfly zone warning messages
    In the following scenario asp warning generation was wrong:
    1.Flying under a nonfly zone, with vertical distance>margin from the base of the airspace
    2.Leaving the zone horizontally, actually flying away from it
    3.Climbing, that vertical distance to base < margin
    4.Because horizontal distance is still low, and vertical distance gets low, warning msg generated.

. Change +SAFETY with + safety altitude arrival  numerical value on overlays

. Reduced vario width for 240x320 portrait resolution
  Only a small reduction, otherwise it becomes invisible in real use

. Transparent vario bar has no borders, for better transparency

. Reduced Topology label character width 700 to 600 in 480x272. Changed label colors making them lighter a bit.
  On sept,9th I had darkened them too much.




FIXES

. Oracle should not work when there is no valid Gps fix.

. Fix TrueWind using Magnetic declination to correct true heading

. (minor) Correct PG/Delta Time Gates into PG/HG

. FIX BestAlternate search bugs, excluding nearest outlanding when low on terrain and choosing not the best.
  OVERSAFETY altitude (100m) no more used, because of too conservative results. We use only 70% glide best capability
  and safety altitude.





Version 2.3g September 23 2011
------------------------------


NEW

. Airspace 2.4 page settings are now permanently saved to a config file on shutdown.
  It is now possible to select and airspace, enable/disable a single airspace, and 
  make these changes permanent.
  Be careful that changing airspace file will also remove old settings!

. New Battery indicator is appearing in the right bottom corner
  decreasing in green and becoming red when battery is nearly empty.

. New Logger indicator near the battery indicator in the right bottom corner.
    If autologger is disabled, and logging was NOT manually enabled, then
    this indicator will NOT show up. 
    The logger indicator in fact appear only when logging is automatic or 
    manually enabled.

    Orange dot blinking means: ready to log as soon as takeoff is detected.
    Red dot steady (not blinking) means: logging in progress.

. New Logger INFOBOX, showing  ON if logger is active, no!  if disabled and not manually forced, Auto
    if enabled but not logging because before takeoff.

. New IS28B2 Lark polars



CHANGES

. Change delta to hang glider in messages

. Fast Topology cache re-enabled after fixing a problem with zoomed topology.

. BestAlternate rotate multitarget available for PG/HG only if a valid bestalternate
    was ever found so far during the flight. If no landables are configured, or if these
    landables have never been elected to a bestalternate, then rotation will skip this choice.
    In other words: if nothing can be found, even if an old bestalternate which is now unreachable,
    then instead of showing --- we skip it.



FIXES

. FIX critical problem that could lead to software crash on some PNAs

. FIX 2.3f problem with Master Time Reset on some gps units.
  Causing severe system malfunctions: no ground thermal detection, no loggin, unusable !!


. FIX infobox geometry in engineering menu removed, it was crashing the sw being unused.

. Fix profile saving: on exit, only default profile is rewritten.
    Selecting on startup a profile will load that profile, and save it as default on exit.
    If you want to re/write an existing profile, you must do it manually.
    It will not be automatically overwritten on exit.

. Fix profile problem not loading aircraft type bitmaps, unless using DEFAULT profile.
    Still changing aircraft type requires software restarts,

. Fix: do not use airspaces with no name defined.

. Fix airspace parser reads wrong altitude
    Malformed alt specification causes the parser to read wrong values.
    For ex:
    AL FL 65 (MNM ALT 5500FT)




Version 2.3f September 16 2011
------------------------------

NEW

. New Total Energy configuration in Safety parameters
    When TotalEnergy is in use, LK will calculate the height you would gain by pulling up the aircraft at the current speed, up
    until the speed becomes the optimal for best glide.
    For example if you are flying at 200kmh with a discus with no ballast, the speed energy would be calculated as if you would
    pull up and slow down to 100kmh: you would certainly climb to a better altitude of course.
    This speed height will be added to all arrival altitudes. By default this feature is DISABLED, for safety reasons.

    The totalenergy in LK does not affect glide ratio values. Only arrival altitudes.

. New Total Energy button in Config 2/3 menu

. New customkey Toggle Total Energy
. New customkey Notepad

. New Button DISPLAY 1/3 and CustomKey "Change Terrain Color".
    It will rotate among the available terrain colors, in real time.
    So it's now possible to adapt map colors to the current terrain.

. New +SAFETY overlay indicator on map display.
    When the multitarget is a landable waypoint, and safetyaltitude is in use,
    and safetyaltitude was set as at least 50m, then the +SAFETY is printed
    below the arrival altitude.


CHANGES

. Task speeds <99 are now printed with one decimal value.
    Airspace selection back available with a long click on them on the moving map, even if
    no activemap is enabled. Airspace selection has priority over all customkeys, as it was before.

. Overlay distance for paragliders using 3 decimals.
    Bottom bar using max 2 decimals, even for paragliders.
    Lets remember that the gps fix precision is not better than 4-5 meters
    in the best of cases! When logging for a competition with another logger,
    the two gps may have different distances to the waypoint, and using 3
    decimals will result in a false reading.

. Removed FLARM on MAP/Scaled mode: confusing, and never fixed.
    If an icon is painted on the map, it should be in its correct position.
    Scaled mode was an earlier radar mode in fact, but LK has no radar mode implemented.

. Oracle 2, "The Oracle Strikes Back" (more serious sounds, using also big cities, more informations, all uppercase)



FIXES

. Bugfix TaskETE was not calculated when not enough height to complete the task.
    Task ETE is a simple DistanceToGo / SpeedAchievedSoFar




Version 2.3e September 10 2011
------------------------------

NEW

. The Oracle
  Oracle is printing informations about your position, by examining both topology and waypoints,
  and figuring out a reasonable position reporting to be used via the radio.
  Oracle is creating a verbose description of your position.
  You can call the oracle with a button in INFO 1/2  and also with a customkey that you can 
  configure. By default it is assigned to the new CENTER SCREEN customkey.


. New customkey CENTER SCREEN, and changes in airspace selection.
    Center Screen is a customkey called by clicking for at least 1 second
    in the map center area (with some good tolerance). By default this CK
    is assigned with the "Oracle" function.
    If PAN mode is enabled, this key will not work.
    >>Airspace details now are possible by clicking on them only if ActiveMap is enabled.

. PC version using current execution directory as LK8000 folder, if _System/_SYSTEM folder and file are found.
    If no directory _System is found , or there is no _SYSTEM file inside, then we go using the old classic
    Documents LK8000 folder, as usual, which is the old default folder.

. Ungestures: in 2.x 3.x 4.x pages, an alternate mode for advancing through pages (aside gestures, still valid) is to
    simply click on the left and right screen border, in the center.
    +-----------------+
    |                 |
    |                 |
    |X               X|
    |                 |
    |                 |
    +-----------------+

    Gestures are still available of course, but this facility is speeding up page flipping a lot!


. Add FLARM traffic to simulator, if FLARM on Map is enabled in system config menu 13.
    Four flarm objects are added around the plane. One of them will become a ghost and a zombie quite soon.
    Objects are moving a bit, but just to let you experiment with traffic on LK.
    Page 4.1 TRF is of course enabled, and FlarmNet is used as in real life.
    Overlay multitarget F> is also enabled, and need an object selected in 4.1.
    Selecting a target in 4.1 will show it in page 4.3 and 4.2 .
    All of this is useful for making practice with FLARM traffic and explore the 4.3 sight page.
    Do not expect to have a videogame, because traffic is not moving as in real life.

    >> If you dont want FLARM simulation, please disable "Flarm on Map" in config menu 13


CHANGES

. E.20s added one decimal for LD value
. Airspace details now are possible by clicking on them ONLY if ActiveMap is enabled.

. Custom key selection list is now alpha-sorted.
. Overlay distances for paragliders have always 3 decimal digits, when the distance is not 0 and below 99.

. Topology labels using a darker PETROL color, for better contrast on the moving map

. Radius size in task setting has now a 0.05 step for better precision
  So it is now possible to use correct cylinder sizes expressed in imperial
  units like miles.

. MC buttons will hide AutoMC buttons if manual changes are selected.
  This will show screen overlays in landscape mode.
  Pressing on Manual, will make them appear again.


FIXES

. Analisys page correctly working full screen with better visibility
. (2.3) Font quality not applied correctly (antialiasing)
. Fix 2.3 paraglider Home overlay H> no more working using TAKEOFF

. Fix topology problem making small towns not appear immediately on the map
  and appearing back only after some zooms.
  (Bug due to accelerator engine which is now temporarily disabled until fixed:
   some huge topology files may run slower now, until the accelerator is back).

. Fix Simulator problem when no valid terrain available.
  Looping into creation of thermals and flarm objects !!






--------------------------
Version 2.3d  August 26 2011

AAT Rework by Mat, changes & fixes:

. Drawing of thermal bar disabled for Target PAN map mode
. Target PAN sectors position set to the screen center
. AAT target symbols printing fixed
. Drawing of a AAT task fixed for Target PAN screen
. Drawing of bearing to the target instead of waypoint fixed for AAT task

. Target dragging switched to clicking for AAT Target PAN dialog
  Dragging a small circle on the screen is not a turbulence proof interface.
  It is extremely hard to do it during a turbulent flight. Now a click is
  enough to move AAT target inside the AAT area.

. Target PAN zoom level increased a bit to make it easier to move the target
. Orientation of active waypoint fixed in Target PAN to not rotate the screen constantly while selecting AAT target
. Multitarget bearing line fixed for non-waypoint overlays in AAT task


NEW

. OziExplorer waypoint format supported

. New PLKAS   NMEA sentence.
    The syntax is:
    $PLKAS,nnn,*checksum
    where nnn is the Indicated Air Speed in m/s *10
    and checksum is the NMEA checksum
    Example for nnn  346 = 34.6 m/s  which is = 124.56 km/h
    This sentence can be sent anytime, with any device connected.
    It is normally a sub sentence of the LK8EX1 device.

. New customkey Screen Lock

. New Location Markers 

  To mark the current position in a waypoint, use the button on the main menu or the customkey.
  A virtual waypoint called MK123456  will be created , assuming in the example that the time
  was 12:34.45 (local time). 
  The waypoint detail's description field will report the nearest known waypoint 
  (for example   Near: London).
  Markers will appear as waypoint inside both 2.3 TPS and 3.1 COMMON pages.
  Markers are inserted in the COMMON 3.1 pages as Last-in First-out.
  They are inserted after the usual commons (home, bestalternate, alternates, task points..).
  Up to 10 virtual waypoints for markers are allowed. Creating a new marker beyond this number
  will overwrite the oldest existing marker.
  On the moving map, markers will appear with a yellow Flag icon.

  All markers are also saved to a CUP file called with the current date, like LKyyyymmdd.cup .
  So each flight in a different day will have its own markers cup file, that can be reloaded as
  an ordinary waypoint file anytime.


CHANGES

. Initial circling zoom increased a bit
. Fix simulator mode speed for paragliders.
  Dragging the aircraft was causing the ground speed to raise too much

. Airspace support for airspace files containing V sentences
  with no space beetween V and X characters (for example, Rieti's official airspaces)

. Reduced config page 12.Font edit
    Only Map waypoints and Topology labels can be changed for fonts.
    Anything else is under control of fine tuned configuration.

. Fix sticky AutoMC problem using EqMC.
    Leaving a thermal, EqMC wouldnt be set valid if flying below MC 0 speed. In this case, AutoMC would not
    be set with a valid EqMC and thus would remain sticky to the old value, in use before entering the thermal.
    Now we accept negative MC between >-1.0 and we assume for example that a -0.3MC is really a 0.3.

. Old HomeWaypoint, Alternates and TeamReference waypoint  no longer valid, due to change of internal waypoint structure

. Using DEFAULT_MENU.TXT common for all languages.
  We can have different menus for GA, Paragliders, gliders now.
  Old ENG_MENU  FRA_MENU  etc. are no longer used. Translators will need to only work on a single MSG file.
  DEFAULT_MENU.TXT is now positioned inside the System folder and it is not supposed to be edited by users.

. Fix FL (Flight Level) using standard pressure altitude.
  Current altitude (Baro if available, otherwise Gps altitude) is transformed into pressure relative to the
  current QNH stored, and then this pressure is converted back to altitude using 1013.25 QNE pressure.
  The resulting altitude -QNE Altitude- is converted to feet, and divided by 100. The integer part of this
  number is the Flight Level.



FIXES

. (2.3) Fix align flags chars in 2.4 nearest asp page, SFE chars overwriting brg in some portrait mode
. (2.3) Fix 2.3 bug Font Smoothing no more working correctly.  Apply font smoothing changes work also on PC version.
. (2.3) Fix L> last thermal name not updated.
        It was correctly pointing to the new thermal, but the name was not updated.

. (2.3) Fix for determining flaps settings when using different units than kph

. (2.3) Fix system setup bug: Number of time gates wrong position, missing header

. (2.3) remove screen flicker on all Dialog





--------------------------
Version 2.3c  July 31 2011

NEW

. New support for Medion S3747 aka Royaltek BV-3200 aka other brands. Baro altitude is managed.

. New support for Holux FunTrek aka CompeGps rebranded device, full support for battery power,
  resolution, baro altitude etc.

. New page 3.3 Thermal History

  This page can be also disabled as usual. It will list up to 50 thermals, out of a max 100,
  related to current flight. Thermals cannot be saved! 
  Each thermal listed is showing usual values as in the nearest page, and the average lift.
  You can sort by distance, bearing, lift and name.

  The thermal name is the local time you entered the thermal , example: th1437 if you entered
  this thermal at 2:37pm .

  Selecting as usual a thermal will pop up a page where you can SELECT it.
  Once selected, the thermal is assigned to the L> multitarget, and you are instantly brought
  to L> moving map.

  - In the thermal details page, a Team Code is shown in order to let you broadcast via radio
    the position of this thermal to friends.

  - A nearby location is shown also in thermal details title window
    The nearest waypoint within 15km is used for this purpose.

  After a new thermal is detected (after thermalling), this thermal is automatically assigned to
  the L> multitarget.

  The L> is always showing the thermal name, ex. H1237  and no more a simple "THERMAL".
  In the 3.3 page, the selected thermal has its name leaded by a > .
  Example:      >H1237
  
  The 3.3 page is listing red and italic all thermals that are currently unreachable.

  >> The thermal position is assigned using the aircraft position just after started thermalling,
     and its altitude. Thus you will be pointed exactly to the place you were (right or wrong)
     just before you started climbing. <<

    When selecting multitarget L> in map mode, a circle will appear around the
    center of the selected thermal, at high zoom levels.
    The circle will not appear at low zoom levels, being not enough visible on
    a small screen.
    The circle is drawn around the thermal center, while the multipoint L> target
    is slightly different because it is indicating the point you have actually
    entered the thermal, and its altitude.
    Thus on the moving map you will see both the entering point, and the thermal center,
    giving you an exact idea of how you started thermalling there, and were you ended up to.

    Some thermals are added for the simulator, appearing in 3.3 in SIM mode only.
    The closest thermal is .. real for the SIM, meaning that going to that
    thermal will show real sink and lift!

. New ALTITUDE ALARMS in Menu Config 15

    There are 3 available altitude (height, really) alarms available.
    An alarm will be triggered everytime the configured altitude is reached or crossed.
    The alarm will not be repeated within the next 60 seconds.
    After 1 minute, if altitude has been lower than Max Altitude and then becomes higher again, alarm will sound again.
    To disable this alarm, set it to 0.
    The altitude used for alarm is the one chosen in Config menu 5 "Use baro altitude".
    Multiple alarms set at the same altitude will have no effect.
    Glider pilots should be careful not to set alarms below a safety altitude, during critical phases of flight.
    Each alarm can be repeated max 30 times. After 30 times, an alarm will automatically self disable for the current flight.
    The visual alarm message automatically disappears after 12 seconds.
    Each alarm has a custom sound that can be changed inside _System _Sounds folder.
    They are named LK_ALARM_ALTx.WAV
    Default is 0 (no alarm).

.   Optimized routes for paragliders.
    Draft, but fully working. Leaning on AAT locked target and virtual waypoints, a pretty effective result.
    THANKS to Donato, DigiFly Europe, for some important parts of the code, help, and support!

    Optimization can be enabled in Paragliders config menu 23, and as a customkey.
    When enabled, the T> overlay, the Next waypoint distance, altitude diff, bearing etc.
    are all related to the optimized turn point on the cylinder.
    The correct optimized point of turn is visualized also.
    The optimized turnpoint is named with a "!" leading. Example: turnpoint name is "JACKHILL"
    as optimized point it will appear as T>!JACKHILL   and also in turnpoint list and nearest pages.
    This is a virtual waypoint, like thermal, takeoff etc.

    Since Optimized Route (O.R.) rely on the internal AAT engine for gliders, it is better that
    paragliders check the TARGET  cylinder radius to be at -100% , in order to let the calculator
    consider the max radius as a turnpoint. By default, but only when you create a new task as
    paraglider with this version, all radius are set to -100%. To check, menu NAV 2/3 and then
    "Target" , then select turnpoints exluding first and last (start and finish).
    Check that Range is -100%, and Radial is 0.

. New Configurable AutoMC on/off on startup, and new overlay indicators aside MC overlay.
  When autoMC is enabled, an "A" is painted aside MC overlay.
  AutoMC indicator is : F (Final glide) A (Average climb)  E (Equivalent)

. New AutoMC buttons and configuration. It is possible to change AutoMC type at runtime now.
  The AutoMC mode is shown as overlay indicator, and through MC buttons a pilot can change
  on the fly MC among manual and all auto modes. Configuration is kept for default value.

. New device driver for Westerboer VW1150

. New customkeys: Airspace Analysis and Toggle Map<>Airspaces page

. New customkeys: Zoom in, Zoom in more, Zoom out, Zoom out more.

. New customkey: Toggle Optimize Route
  Optimize route is a function for paragliders only, right now.

. New Airspace details page, two new buttons for SELECT and ANALYSIS.

   SELECT is used to choose an airspace to be monitored for Hdist and Vdist infoboxes.
   We call the Selected airspace "Preferred".
   
. New airspace 2.4 page flags (the * column on the right)
  E = Enabled
  D = Disabled
  S = Selected
  F = Fly-In modality

  When flying inside an airspace, the Distance instead of 0 is showing IN 
  When flying near an airspace in yellow condition, the Distance is showing a trailing "!".

  All 2.4 rows are painted white, red or yellow (light colors)  following alerting situation.

. New airspace drawing options for drawing airspaces with borders and outlines
  This will actually tell you at a glance where is the internal side of airspace.
  (Warning, this can slow down devices with high screen resolution or slow processor, use with caution!)

. Support 320x234 and 234x320 screen resolutions. Preliminary.
. Support for 240x400 portrait mode

. LOCK mode (Config 1, Lock Mode button) is available for all aircraft modes.
  Paragliding/Hanggliding mode will automatically unlock the device a few seconds after takeoff.
  Other modes (car, GA, gliding) will keep device locked until manually unlocked.
  This is useful on some devices that are pocket-sized such as Funtrek.

. Add ACT indicator in mapscale for ActiveMap status
  ActiveMap can be enabled/disabled with both a customkey and menu button.
  When it is enabled, the indicator appears near the map scale.

. New support for Zander ZS1 including MC and Wind 

. New extended polars with flaps extensions for flaps support:
	SZD-38A Jantar
	LS-6-15
	Lak17A-15
	Lak17A-18
	Nimbus 4
	SZD-56-2 Diana2
	Ventus 2Cx (18m)

.   Add PREROTATE and ENDROTATE external execution programs.
    PREROTATE1.exe PREROTATE2.exe and PREROTATE3.exe will be executed before anything else.
    On exit, ENDROTATE1.exe ENDROTATE2.exe ENDROTATE3.exe will be executed before ENDLOAD_99.EXE .
    Example of how to make the screen rotate 90 degrees on startup, and make it back normal on exit:
    - Copy rotate.exe from System CEUtils folder of LK in the LK8000 folder, where LK8000-PNA.exe is.
    - Rename rotate.exe into  PREROTATE1.exe
    - Copy rotate.exe again, and rename to ENDROTATE1.exe
    - Copy rotate.exe again, and rename to ENDROTATE2.exe
    - Copy rotate.exe again, and rename to ENDROTATE3.exe

    This way, screen is rotate to 90 degrees on startup, and by 270 degrees on exit.

.   Reset FLARM after a task declaration.




CHANGES

. Huge code cleanup, smaller executable size.

. IBOX mode is no more available (button still there, but no effect)

. WEATHER support for RASP is no more available.

. Weather button no more available in menu.

. Enable Contest Engine also for non-glider aircrafts, IF infopage 1.5 is enabled.

    This means that using glider mode will not require 1.5 to be enabled.
    But using paragliding, GA or Car mode will require 1.5 to BE ENABLED otherwise the
    calculation engine will NOT run.
    Be careful enabling during flight calculation engine, because all previous point since the
    takeoff will not be valid, and the freeflight detection will be wrong of course.
    (This feature was really added in 2.3B but forgotten to be mentioned!)

. Show overlay BEARING while circling.
    We could not display bearing difference while thermalling, because it was constantly changing.

. Use manually selected airspace for distance infoboxes. 
  In order to see Hdist and Vdist infoboxes, an airspace must be selected from Airspace details page.

. Airspace warnings working only after 1 minute have passed since takeoff
  This is to reduce pilot overload during critical phases of flight.

. (2.3) ArSpcH Airspace Horizontal distance below 1000m (~3300ft) will display 2 decimals.
  Example, instead of 0.7km it will show 743m  .

. Glide terrain shadow appearing also when not flying, in SIM mode and with an altitude over terrain >100m.

. Enlarge fonts for 400x240 resolution. Nearest pages have now 6 rows.
  Better visibility on small screens.


. Following configuration items were REMOVED from Engineering mode, thus becoming PERMANENTLY removed from LK:

	- VirtualKeys
	VirtualKeys were obsoleted when the new SIM system was active. No need to use them anymore.
	They were basically used at the very beginning of LK to change altitude and speed in infoboxes
	for simulations. Active map is now available on demand by a simple button at runtime.

	- MapLock
	The old maplock system is permanently removed from the code.
	Paragliders have a new screen locking mechanism, much better.

	- STF Risk Factor
	- Block Speed To Fly
	- Text Input Style 
	- Animation
	- Status Message alignement
	- WindArrow

. Following configuration items are MOVED to Engineering mode, thus becoming candidated for permanent removal from LK:

	. ActiveMap
	ActiveMap is a good candidate for no configuration. There is a button to activate active map on demand.
	There is also a customkey for it.

. AAT min time step is now 5 minutes, and no more 10

. Traffic page updated for data only every 5 seconds, like all nearest pages.


FIXES

. Fix problem with HP314 resetting flight stats

. Fix do not allow resizing menu buttons on PNA 800x480 devices

. Bugfix Logger problem: it may not write correctly the entire task declaration to IGC file.

. Fix possible crash upon switching off and back on after some hours the PNA during flight.

. Fix problem with huge waypoint files, when turnpoints and landables > 500 in the range of 75km (tps) or 150km (lnd).
  This is a borderline situation, but may happen expecially with turnpoints since we use flat land distance approximation.
  We are talking about having more than 500 waypoint around us, in 75km radius.

. Fix update in-range waypoint list when we get first valid GPS fix! Update also on SIMMODE pan reposition.
  This was an annoying problem: the nearest pages were made using a range waypoint list that was using
  as a current position our homewaypoint, or our center-terrain (assigned as Takeoff, which was assigned to HomeWaypoint).
  This is ok, but only until we do get a real valid fix. Now as soon as we get the first valid fix, we
  recalculate the in-range waypoints.

. Fixed (2.3) "unknown airspace warning message" when a message gets repeated during flying outside a fly zone
. Fixed (2.3)  Do not calculate airspace data when no valid gps fix

. Fixed no nearest turnpoints showing if no landables were available in at least on waypoint file.
  Bug introduced when nearest turnpoint pages and landables were unified at code level. Very old.

. Fix (2.3) dlgairspacedetails range field, displaying "to enter" or "to leave" based on horiz ditance, not inside, which includes altitude as well.

. Fix bug AAT next waypoint target bearing and bearing diff wrong .
  They were always related to waypoint center, and not to the target

. Task Edit / Analysis  will bring to task analysis page, which was not working.

. Fix glidebar painting arrow based on a value that was ignoring safetyMC in some cases.

. Fix LK not checking battery with LKBatteryManager while inside infopages. This might result in delayed warnings about battery.

. Fix (2.3) Flaps using characters for name, and not a number. This was a real problem, since you could not assign for
  example S1 to a flap position related to a IAS speed, for example.

. Fix (2.3) bug in infopage traffic, not advancing beyond first page.

. Fix airspace parser arc and sector calc
  If someone wants to make an arc within  0-7.5degree or (360-7.5)-360 degree range nothing added to the polygon list...

. Fix replay logger problem not resetting some variables in flightstats

    This will not solve at 100% all replay problems when replaying several IGC files. Currently the only safe solution is
    to restart LK to be sure all statistics are reset correctly.

. Fix bug not calculating TC.Avg and Th.All at flight startup.

    LKCalculation freeflight detection was resetting StartClimbMode and this was bad.
    Because StartClimbMode is set before we actually start climbing, and discarded if
    after a few turns we are not really circling.
    FF engine is also using the first thermal to detect FF, and this was causing a sort of a loop.
    The problem was more likely to appear only in IGC flight replay mode in simulation.
    However, even in real flight there was 1/100 of chances to get this (minor) problem.





-------------------
Version 2.3b 110609

NEW

. Menu 15 in config, for Alarms - still not operational


CHANGES

. Orbiter enabled only after 50m thermal gain achieved. Below this gain, we assume the thermal center is not valid.
  Orbiter will autodisable after 700m thermal gain. Thus it is now working in the 50-700m th.gain range.
. 2.4 nearest airspace page contains airspaces in maximum 100km range
. Airspace nearest vertical distance infobox shows vertical distance to an airspace directly above or below at current position (or to leave a fly zone)
. Airspace nearest horizontal distance infobox shows horizontal distance to an airspace at the current altitude (or to leave a fly zone)

. Config menu 15 Task rules moved to Menu 14 as a button

FIXES

. Fix a bug in 2.3a causing again sometimes the "White Screen of Pain" problem on startup.
. Fix Airspace parser, coordinate parsing fails if coords given in DD:MM:SS<spc><spc>X format


-------------------
Version 2.3a 110603

NEW

. New configuration for Polars (requires reconfiguring polar type!)
. Many new polars

. New FLAPS setting calculator , for extended polars 

. New IMI ERIXX logger support, also for task declaration

. New configurable BottomBar.
    System config menu 10 let you configure individually each bottombar stripe.
    While rotating, only desired stripes will be shown.
    Even if all bars are set off, NAV1 is shown.
    Thermal mode will keep showing THR 0 bar.

. New configurable Infopages.
    System config menu 10 let you configure individually each infopage, except traffic.
    If all pages of a branch (for example, all 2.x pages) are OFF, then that branch will not be selected
    during rotation.
    Direct access to pages through custom keys is always possible, bypassing this configuration.
    Traffic pages 4.x - when Flarm is detected - are always available. If you don't want traffic informations, 
    then please disable these traffic data being sent by flarm in its protocol, and save CPU.

. New Color scheme for GA: relative terrain.
    This scheme will show red any terrain above current altitude.
    Anything below, up to 500ft below, will be graded to yellow.
    This scheme is NOT good for gliders, because it does not consider the loss of altitude while gliding.
    It is intended to be used by general aviation mode, optionally activated by a button.

. New Info Status System indicators for :
	Simulator mode
	GPS device in use for fix
	Software version

. New infobox Home Arrival altitude

. ------- New AIRSPACE handling ENGINE ----------

  . NEW 2.4 nearest airspace page

  . New airspace storage classes (CAirspace, CAirspaceCicrle, CAirspaceArea)
  . New CAirspaceManager singleton class for managing airspace operations
  . New openair parser based on the old one
  . New airspace distance calculation algorithms
  . New TMZ airspace class for handling TMZ zones separated from OTHER zones

  . NOFLY/FLY airspaces introduced.
    . NOFLY zones - works like the old airspaces. You are in a wrong position when you are inside a nofly zone.
      Warning events based on this, so if you try to enter a nofly zone you get warnings to not do that.
    . FLY zones - Zones you should be in to be safe. You are in a good position when you are inside a fly zone.
      Warning event based on to remain in a fly zone, so if you try to leave it you get warnings to not do that.
      Flying to an adjacent fly zone is permitted, in that case no warnings issued. (For ex. corridors beetween
      different fly zones)
      In the openair file the AF sentence defines a zone as fly, or you can change it from the UI.

  . Current / predicted position
    Predicted position of the aircraft calculated by lk. This calculation based on current mode (circling/cruise),
    ground and vertical speed, and the configured warning time. This is the time before an airspace warning event
    is estimated at which the system will warn the pilot. Warning messages based on predicted and current position
    as well.

  . Warning levels, warning messages
    . Yellow warning:
      Your current position near a warning situation. This means that you have a possibility to be in a wrong position
      in the given warning time. (30sec by default). There are two types of yellow situation:
      Predicted warning situation - your predicted posititon in a wrong zone (same as old airspaces case)
      Near to a warning situation - You too close horizontally or vertically to a warning position.
      (Too close comes from actual speed and nearest warning point distance and from the configured warning time)
    . Red warning:
      Your current position is wrong, you shouldn't be there because that position violates airspace rules.
      (For example you enter a nofly zone, or you leave a fly zone)
    . New airspace warning dialog
      . Shows the reason of the message, warning level, name of airspace, horizontal and vertical distance, airspace
        base and top altitude
      . Dialog auto closes after a configured time automatically, or you can close it
      . There is a possibility to acknowledge the given warning level for a configured time to not show up again.
      . The old one still accessible under Info1/Analysis/Airspace/Warnings button
    . Acknowledging
      . Each airspace has a warning level and a corresponding ack level. 
      . Actual warning level calculated by LK based on distances, fly/nofly zones, etc.
      . Ack level set by the user, by acknowledging warning messages.
      . The warning message appears only if the warning level increases above the ack level. Lets see a few examples:
          1.You are circling in a position where a no warning/yellow warning situation flipping. When a yellow warning
            situation occurs a warning dialog appears. If you do not press the ack button then in every circle the new
            warning dlg will appear beacuse warning level > ack level. But if you ack the yellow warning then the dialog
            not shows up again in the yellow warning case for a configured time. If the ack time (120s) expires, then the
            ack level goes back to zero, so the warning will appear again.
          2.The same case if you are circling at a nofly zone border. Half circle inside the zone. This is a yellow/red
            warning flipping. If you ack the red warning for a time, then you won't get a new warning message on every circle.
      . Daily acknowledging - enable/disable an airspace
        There is a possibility to disable an airspace (until lk restart). You can do that from airspace
        details dialog (long click on map), pressing the Disable button. Disabling an airspace means that warning
        dialog will never appear for that airspace, and it is not shown on the map as well.
    . Warning dialog messages can be:
      . "Predicted leaving FLY zone" : Current position inside, predicted position outside a flyzone (YELLOW)
      . "Near leaving FLY zone" : Current position inside a flyzone, but you are too close to the border to leave it (YELLOW)
      . "Leaving FLY zone" : You have just leaved the fly zone (RED)
      . "Predicted entering NOFLY zone" : Current position outside, predicted position inside a nofly zone (YELLOW)
      . "Near entering NOFLY zone" : Current position outside a flyzone, but you are too close to the border to enter it (YELLOW)
      . "Entering NOFLY zone" : You have just entered the nofly zone (RED)
    . New airspace info messages
      . When leaving a nonfly zone
      . When entering a (new)fly zone

  . New UI features
    . Long click on the map shows an extended airspace details dialog. 
      . In the type field FLY/NOFLY displayed
      . There is a new button to set an airspace to FLY/NOFLY.
      . Daily Ack changed to Enable/Disable
      . Enable/Disable and Fly/Nofly buttons do not close the dialog automatically, and do not pop up a confirmation dialog 
      . The order of the airspaces sorted by top altitude. Lowest first.
    . Airspace warning labels on map
      . Can be disabled from config page2/Warnings
      . Shows a red mark on the nearest posititon to a warning situation
      . Shows airspace name, and the vertical distance to the border
      . Vertical distance negative if airspace border above, positive if below your current altitude. (like in landables case)
      . Label color means:
        - Black - vertical distance ok, you are in good position vertically
        - Red - vertical distance wrong against that nofly zone
        - Orange - vartical distance wrong against that fly zone

    . New infobox showing nearest vertical distance to an airspace (or to leave a fly zone)
    . New infobox showing nearest horizontal distance to an airspace (or to leave a fly zone)


CHANGES

. Polars are now files inside _Polars folder, and can be viewed and edited.
. Extended polars are possible for use of FLAPS settings indicator. See Example.plr  file in _Polars.

. Device configuration has type "DISABLED", no more confusion.

. Changes regarding airspaces:
  . Drawing order of airspaces changed. They are draw from lowest top altitude first.
  . Daily acked (now disabled) airspaces are not drawed on the map
  . Infobox nearest airspace shows the horizontal distance to the nearest airspace (or to leave a fly zone)
  . In airspace details dialog (long click on map) ACKDay button behaviour changed, now it shows a simple question to toggle actual ackday setting.
  . Airspace ACK Day functionality changed to disabled/enabled
  . Enable/Disable and Fly/Nofly buttons do not close the dialog automatically, and do not pop up a confirmation dialog 
  . Config page 2 reordered, some parameters moved under page accessible by pressing the "Warnings" button

. Paragliders screen unlock is valid by doubleclicking only on lower right screen corner.
    Previously any position was good, leading to possible false unlocks during takeoffs.


BUG FIX

. Fix bug in 4.1 traffic page: using this page for a long time may lead to system locks. This is a critical fix.

. Fix AutoQNH problem. Takeoff wp was used in place of Home first!
    Correct mode now is: look for home, if no home nearby, look for another known waypoint near 2km.
    Do not consider TAKEOFF as a valid waypoint for QNH because it is itself assigned an altitude!
    If no waypoints nearby, and no home, use terrain altitude if available.

. Fix a possible problem of UTF8 characters on very old devices, that may show as funny tokens appearing in place of text.
  This was due to missing UTF8 support on some old operating system like Windows CE 3.0. The patch has been tested on
  CE 3.0 Ipaq 3630.

. Fix cheap chinese PNA bugs, when system messages appear lk is crashing with exception 0xC000001C
