MANUAL ADDENDUM for 4.1 


BLUETOOTH EASY SERIAL PORT SETUP

If your device has Bluetooth radio and it is compatible with LK:

MENU > CONFIG > CONFIG > LK8000 Setup > Device Setup

You will find a new button on the left:  Bluetooth.

1 Switch on the external device you want to connect to LK, switch on its BT radio, and make it a discoverable *VISIBLE) device.
  NOTE: LK is AUTOMATICALLY SWITCHING ON AND OFF BLUETOOTH ON THE PNA

2 Then click on the Bluetooth button , and you will see a new page with a list of known devices, if existing.
3 Click on the left button "Lookup" to search for new devices in range.
4 Select the device you want to use, and then click on the button "Pair".
5 Enter the pin code to pair device, normally 0000 or 1234 , but some devices have a different number so please check, then press OK.
6 The new device is now listed as "Paired".
7 Close and return to Device configuration. Click on Port selection.
8 Scroll at the bottom of devices, you will find your new device! Select it.

you are done! The device is now connected.

Remeber to switch on the device before running LK next time. If you dont do that, you will get an error on startup, but no problems. Switch on device, and then config config config  Reset comms.


BLUETOOTH IGC LOGFILE TRANSFER to SMARTPHONES

Some PNA with BlueTooth support such as the Vertica V2 and similar devices, can transfer a log file to another device, like an android smartphone. 

Call MENU, INFO, INFO, LOGBOOK  >  new button "IGC Send File".
You are now looking at the list of files inside the Logger folder.
Choose one file and then press SEND button.

In order to work, the smartphone must:
1) Have BlueTooth switched ON and in VISIBLE state
2) accept OBEX file transfers through BlueTooth.

Normally Android phones do not have OBEX support, so you need to install a small APP you can find on Google Play, such as "BlueTooth File Transfer" by Medieval Software, which is free of charge or less than 2 euro without advertising.  
This APP offers in configuration also the capability to be VISIBLE : remember to do it.
Your phone BT must be set VISIBLE in order to let LK discover it!

After you click on SEND button, LK8000 will search for BT devices in range, and offer you the list of discovered devices offering OBEX support: choose yours and the file transfer will begin.
In a few seconds, you will normally find the IGC file inside the root folder of your SD card (on an android phone running the Medieval Software app).


INTERNAL GPS DRIVER 

On some PNAs it is possible to by-pass the selection of the COM port, and "talk" directly to the GPS through the use of a library called "Intermediate driver". We call this device "Internal".
If for any reason you dont want or you cannot access the internal GPS on a COM port, you can try to use this approach.

Config > Config > Device Setup > Name
you normally had "Generic" here, if you were using the internal gps. Go to beginning of the list and select
> Internal

You will not see the COM port anymore, because it is no longer used by the intenal driver.


PC SCREEN RESOLUTION SETTINGS

Support any PC resolution by startup parameters, passed to command line.
Example:  -x=500 -y=300
An alternate method to obtain -480x272  is -x=480 -y=272
x and y must be in the range of 100 to 3000 pixels.


NEW CUSTOMKEYS

Reset View . It will instantly bring screen to moving map , and reset all infopages to the first.

    "VFR Landing" reminder is displayed (and glide slope hided) when at less than 1.5 Km from the final desitination.
    When the next WP is also the final destination on the left are displayed: speed, vertical speed (in Ft/min) and height from the ground.

New device LXV7 easy
    simple reception of voltage, IAS and baro altitude from V7, but nothing else.
    V7 is standalone for configuration, and LK too. What you do on V7 is unrelated to what you do on LK.

 Add support for the chinese bluetooth keyboards.
    This is the first layout manager, BTK1.
    The keyboard should be kept vertically with the space key on the right.
    There is no need to look at it for using LK: simply think to be clicking on a screen:
    think of the keyboard like it was a touchscreen.
    The only special key is the corner SHIFT which is used as <enter> to confirm a goto.
    To advance to next pages such as in landables, turnpoints etc, use the top screen keys.
to use the keyboard, configure device type in device page, Keyboard 1.

Added bearing to next waypoint indication to HSI
Draw CDI scale anyway in grey also during direct GOTO.

Add Sonar Warning configuration in config Alarm page.
    By default Sonar is enabled. The configuration choice is set on startup.

CHANGES

Default zoom level for multimap MM1 in paragliding mode changed to 20km.

NavFunctions: Use precise formula in FindLatitudeLongitude()

Target dialog for AAT sector fixed
Before the change a Target dialog for narrow AAT sector (like 90o - 180o) was
centered at the center of the circle used to draw the sector and zoomed
to view 2x its radius. Because of that sector was really hard to manage in
AAT tasks. Now the same sector is centered on the screen and stretched on full
screen.

Skip Alternate 1, Alternate 2 and Last Thermal in multitarget rotate if is not defined.




FIXES

Fix wrong lines drawing in task and topology at high zoom levels, due to overflow in distance calculations
