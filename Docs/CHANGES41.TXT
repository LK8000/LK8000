MANUAL ADDENDUM for 4.1 


BLUETOOTH EASY SERIAL PORT SETUP

If your device has Bluetooth radio and it is compatible with LK:

MENU > CONFIG > CONFIG > LK8000 Setup > Device Setup

You will find a new button on the left:  Bluetooth.

1 Switch on the external device you want to connect to LK, switch on its BT radio, and make it a discoverable *VISIBLE) device.
  NOTE: LK is AUTOMATICALLY SWITCHING ON AND OFF BLUETOOTH ON THE PNA

2 Then click on the Bluetooth button , and you will see a new page with a list of known devices, if existing.
3 Click on the left button "Lookup" to search for new devices in range.
4 Select the device you want to use, and then click on the button "Pair".
5 Enter the pin code to pair device, normally 0000 or 1234 , but some devices have a different number so please check, then press OK.
6 The new device is now listed as "Paired".
7 Close and return to Device configuration. Click on Port selection.
8 Scroll at the bottom of devices, you will find your new device! Select it.

you are done! The device is now connected.

Remeber to switch on the device before running LK next time. If you dont do that, you will get an error on startup, but no problems. Switch on device, and then config config config  Reset comms.


BLUETOOTH IGC LOGFILE TRANSFER to SMARTPHONES

Some PNA with BlueTooth support such as the Vertica V2 and similar devices, can transfer a log file to another device, like an android smartphone. 

Call MENU, INFO, INFO, LOGBOOK  >  new button "IGC Send File".
You are now looking at the list of files inside the Logger folder.
Choose one file and then press SEND button.

In order to work, the smartphone must:
1) Have BlueTooth switched ON and in VISIBLE state
2) accept OBEX file transfers through BlueTooth.

Normally Android phones do not have OBEX support, so you need to install a small APP you can find on Google Play, such as "BlueTooth File Transfer" by Medieval Software, which is free of charge or less than 2 euro without advertising.  
This APP offers in configuration also the capability to be VISIBLE : remember to do it.
Your phone BT must be set VISIBLE in order to let LK discover it!

After you click on SEND button, LK8000 will search for BT devices in range, and offer you the list of discovered devices offering OBEX support: choose yours and the file transfer will begin.
In a few seconds, you will normally find the IGC file inside the root folder of your SD card (on an android phone running the Medieval Software app).


INTERNAL GPS DRIVER 

On some PNAs it is possible to by-pass the selection of the COM port, and "talk" directly to the GPS through the use of a library called "Intermediate driver". We call this device "Internal".
If for any reason you dont want or you cannot access the internal GPS on a COM port, you can try to use this approach.

Config > Config > Device Setup > Name
you normally had "Generic" here, if you were using the internal gps. Go to beginning of the list and select
> Internal

You will not see the COM port anymore, because it is no longer used by the intenal driver.


PC SCREEN RESOLUTION SETTINGS

Support any PC resolution by startup parameters, passed to command line.
Example:  -x=500 -y=300
An alternate method to obtain -480x272  is -x=480 -y=272
x and y must be in the range of 100 to 3000 pixels.


NEW CUSTOMKEYS

Reset View . It will instantly bring screen to moving map , and reset all infopages to the first.



OTHER IMPORTANT CHANGES IN 5.0

TASK FILE FORMAT is now XML, text-based, and can be edited.
Old task files can still be loaded.

Multimap page 2, final glide page, empowered with new informations.
Automatically providing the minimal, current and max MC possible for the final glide, considering wind and obstacles.



============
Version 4.1o
============

NEW

 Add new infobox for Heading . Showing magnetic heading if available from an external instrument; otherwise showing
   the estimated heading calculated internally.

 Add infoboxes  for Alternate1 and Alternate2 radials.
    The name of alternate waypoint is printed, after a "<" character which
    is there to indicate the radial value, opposite to bearing angle.
    
 Add infobox for Bank Angle



CHANGES

 Change 5th value of ALT infoboxes from FL to aALT, and viceversa.
    aALT is the alternate unit altitude, for example if distance unit is km, this is in nm.
    If it is nm or sm, this is km.

 In landscape mode only, show alternate distance and radial for waypoint details





FIXES

 CAI302 fix for many errors relative to inaccurate baro altitude and indicated air speed calculation.
       QNH sent by the instrument is now received and set inside LK too.

 Fix HeadWind calculation using TAS if available. This value is shown in infoboxes.

. GA mode: find and use departure and destination airfields from WP list (1 Km tolerance) when loading a task (GPX, CUP or LKT).

CHANGES

. Disable vario in EYE device driver, not working correctly.
  It is sending 0.5 m/s steps, which is too much inaccurate for our purposes.
  In fact we use Vario value for many functions, including free flight detection.
  Using internally calculated now.
. Do not use EYE pitch and roll sensor data, not available. 
  Otherwise page 1.6 not working!!

. ZigZag wind calculation retuned for more tolerance to long thermalling time

  digifly, Flytec and Zander

. Fix automc not using thermal average if no task is set
. Fix do not show 0.0 safety Mc, because it is not a safe MC.
     This is configured in safety parameter, but can also be set to 0. In such case..
. Fix simulator using IAS for advancing, instead of Ground speed.
     Resulting with inaccurate arrival altitude simulations

. Fix locks and freezes possible with reset comm ports
. Fix do not reset flight stats if a gps error occurs during flight








============
Version 4.1m
============

NEW

Add customkey DspMode , accessing Display 3/3 page.

    "VFR Landing" reminder is displayed (and glide slope hided) when at less than 1.5 Km from the final desitination.
    When the next WP is also the final destination on the left are displayed: speed, vertical speed (in Ft/min) and height from the ground.

New device LXV7 easy
    simple reception of voltage, IAS and baro altitude from V7, but nothing else.
    V7 is standalone for configuration, and LK too. What you do on V7 is unrelated to what you do on LK.

GA mode:
    Consider departure waypoint already reached if we are in a beam of half runway length from the departure airfield.
    In a task draw intermediate WPs of type line always of the same size independently from zoom level.
    Don't display popups (and make beep) when starting and ending a task

New icons (made by Massimo Belloni) for missing CUP tunrpoints type

    This is necessary expecially while checking MC STF using imperial units.

Wind ZigZag more accurate, but requiring also more samples on startup

GA Task: start at departure, remove start-end popups, draw WP lines


FIXES

fix eqMC calculation 

Fix 1.7 page appearing before 1.6 when nothing else available on startup

CHANGES

Default zoom level for multimap MM1 in paragliding mode changed to 20km.

NavFunctions: Use precise formula in FindLatitudeLongitude()

Target dialog for AAT sector fixed
Before the change a Target dialog for narrow AAT sector (like 90o - 180o) was
centered at the center of the circle used to draw the sector and zoomed
to view 2x its radius. Because of that sector was really hard to manage in
AAT tasks. Now the same sector is centered on the screen and stretched on full
screen.

Skip Alternate 1, Alternate 2 and Last Thermal in multitarget rotate if is not defined.




FIXES

Fix wrong lines drawing in task and topology at high zoom levels, due to overflow in distance calculations
